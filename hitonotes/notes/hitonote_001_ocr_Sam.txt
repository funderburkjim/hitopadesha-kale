<jAhnavI</s> an epithet of the river Ganges, considered as the daughter of king Jahnu. Bhagiratha, wishing to purify the bones of his ancestors who were reduced to ashes by Kapila, practised religious austerities and brought down the river Ganga. In its course it inundated the sacrificial ground of king Jahnu, who being angry, drank it up. His anger, however, being appeased by Bhagiratha, he discharged the waters of the river from his ears. Hence the river is spoken of as his daughter.
Here the author follows the rule laid down by writers on Poetics that every poetic composition ought to begin with a benedictory stanza &c.(<s>ASIrnamaskriyAvastunirdeSo vApi tanmuKam</s>)
