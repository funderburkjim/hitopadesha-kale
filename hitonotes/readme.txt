pdfs folder - the scanned images of the 'notes' section of Kale's book.
ocr - Each of the scanned images was processed by the OCR functionality of
 Google Documents.
 The result is the collection of 54 files names 'hitonote_xxx_ocr.txt',
 where xxx goes from 001 to 054.

notes
 Sampada prepared these.  The text is corrected.  Original Devanagari text 
 (which appears in a garbled form in the original OCR files) is represented in 
 form <s>X</s>, where X is SLP1 transliteration of the Devanagari.

 hitonote_xxx_ocr_Sam.txt is the name of the processed file. 
 Sampada's work was done in March-May of 2019.
