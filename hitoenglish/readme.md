The Kale edition of Hitopadesha was scanned into individual pages.
The parts of the English translation chapter is represented by pdfs named
hitoeng001.pdf - hitoeng124.pdf.

Using OCR, each of these files was converted to text files.
Specifically, the OCR is done via Google Drive:
 a) put hitoengXXX.pdf into Google Drive folder of local Windows computer
 b) open Google Drive Application
 c) navigate to hitoengXXX.pdf
 d) right-click : open with Google Docs.
    This does the OCR, and creates a file hitoengXXX.gdoc
 e) Download this file AS plain text file; this makes file
    hitoengXXX.txt in local Downloads folder.
Some editing of the OCR is required, by comparing to the pdf file.
This can be done in step d)  (editing hitoengXXX.gdoc)
or after step e) (editing hitoengXXX.txt).

In this testing area,  all these hitoengXXX.txt files are
loaded into the one file, hitoeng.txt.

Sampada did most of the editing of the ocr.
