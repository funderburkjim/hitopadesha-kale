END OF THE THIRD COLLECTION OF STORIES IN THE HITOPADESA, STYLED 'WAR.'
Chapter IV.
PEACE
At the time of narrating the stories again the princes said--Sir, we have heard about war. Tell us what relates to Peace now. Vishnusarma said--May you listen. I will tell you even about Peace which is introduced by the following verse:--
When the great battle had taken place between the two kings whose armies were annihilated, a peace was made in a moment with their words by the arbiters, the Vulture and the Chakravaka.

The king reflecting for a moment said--This is surely (the play of) my evil luck. For it is said--
It is the fault of (adverse) fate and not of ministers, that a business, although well-planned, sometimes fails, as destiny would have it.
The minister said--This also is said--

The king asked how it was, and the minister related--
