He, who wishes to meddle with matters which are not business of his, lies dead on the ground like the monkey that pulled out the wedge. - 30.

FABLE I.
In a place near the holy forest in the country of Magadha, a certain man of the writer class, Subhadatta by name, was having a convent built. A carpenter had put a wedge between the two split-up parts of a beam which was being cut with a saw and which was cleft to some length. A troop of apes came there prancing about.

Then through the mischievous spirit natural to his species, he drew out the wedge with great effort. As soon as the wedge was pulled out, those parts were squeezed and he perished.

Now the ass said to the dog-Friend, this is properly your office. Why don't you then rouse the master by barking aloud? The dog replied--Friend, you should not meddle with my business. Don't you yourself know that I guard his house day and night? Since he has been happy for a long time he does not know of what use I am to him and takes but scanty care to feed me. For, unless some danger is in sight masters care but little for their servants.
The donkey replied --Hear me, barbarian.
