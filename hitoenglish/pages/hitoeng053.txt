that Ghantakarna being angry devours men and rings the bell, all people fled from the city. Then a certain procuress, Karala by name, thinking--'this sound of the bell is out of time ; can it be that the monkeys ring the bell'â€”and having ascertained for herself that it was so requested the king, saying 'Sire, if a certain amount of money be spent, I will manage this Ghantakarna.'

One should not do any business on one's own responsibility without informing the master of it, except it be to ward off a calamity befalling the king. Moreover,
A minister is like a gourd that gives out little and takes in much. A man who talks lightly* of a moment remains a fool, O king, while one who talks lightly of a cowri remains a pauper.
That minister is the best (for a king) who every day adds (at least) a kakini (to the treasury); for the treasury is the (real) life of a king, and not his own life so.
