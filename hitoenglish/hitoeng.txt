HITOPADESA
; 001.03
May success attend the good in their undertakings (in the object they wish to accomplish ) by the favour of that Dhurjati, on whose head there is a digit of the moon looking like a streak of the foam of the Ganges.
; 001.05
This Hitopadesa (the work inculcating salutary instruction) when studied (lit., carefully attended to) gives (the student) proficiency in elegant speeches, a variety of expression in every department and a knowledge of the conduct of human affairs.
; 001.07
A wise man should think of (acquiring) knowledge and money as though he were not subject to old age or death: but he should perform his religious duties as if Death had seized him by the hair.
; 001.09
Learning, of all things, (the wise) declare to be without a superior (the best of them all ), because of its incapability of being taken away, or valued or exhausted.
;  001.11
Learning, although possessed by a low man, introduces him to the king who is (ordinarily) inapproachable, just as a river, although flowing through a low region, takes one to the inaccessible sea : (sources) from which floweth great fortune (or, the future rests with fortune).
; 001.13
Learning endows one with modesty ; from (having) modesty one passes on to (gets) worthiness ; being worthy one obtains riches ; from riches religious merit and from that happiness.
; 001.15
The knowledge of arms and that of the Sastras - these two lores conduce to glory: but the former exposes one to ridicule in old age, while the latter is ever respected.
; 001.17
As an impression made upon a raw (earthen or so) pot can undergo no change afterwards -- so (following the same principle) in this work the science of conduct (or policy) is taught to youths under the guise of stories. 
[Page 2]
; 002.01
 [The subjects of] "The acquisition of friends", “The separation of friends", "Making war" and “Concluding peace” are written upon, extracts being made from Panchatantra and other works.
; 002.03
On the bank of the Bhagirathi there is a city named Pataliputra. In it there was a king, Sudarshana by name,{;hitoeng002.txt} endowed with all princely qualities. That king once heard a couple of Slokas (stanzas) chanted by some one ; (viz.)
; 002.05
He who does not possess (a knowledge of) Sastra, the universal eye, which totally removes various doubts and discusses things hidden from view, is surely blind.
; 002.07
Youth, abundance of wealth, sovereignty and inconsiderateness are the source of calamity even singly; what then, where all these four are combined !
; 002.09
On hearing this, the king, who was distracted at heart, on account of the non-attendance to (the commands of the) Sastras of his sons who had no knowledge of the Sastras and who always followed the wrong path, thought to himself:
; 002.11
What is the good of (what benefit can accrue from) having a son who is neither learned nor pious (dutiful); (for) what is the use of an eye that is blind? It simply causes occular pain.
; 002.13
Of sons, not born, (born and) dead and foolish, the first two are to be preferred and not the last: (for) the first two cause pain (but) once ; the last at every step. Moreover,
; 002.15
He is (really) born by whose birth the family is exalted. In this revolving world who does not die and is not born again?
; 002.17
If the mother of the boy, for whom the little finger does not bend down hastily at the commencement of the enumeration of the number of meritorious men, be said to have given birth to a son, then say, what a barren woman would be like to (i.e., she is as good as a barren woman).
; 002.19
He, who is not well known for his charity, penance, bravery, learning and the acquisition of wealth, is but the excrement of his mother. Also,
; 002.21
It is better to have one meritorious son than a hundred of foolish ones; the single moon dispels darkness; and not the whole firmament of stars.
; 002.23
The son of him, who has practised religious austerities, extremely difficult to perform, at some holy place, will be obedient, prosperous, righteous and talented.
; 002.25
An influx of money, constant health (lit., freedom from disease), a beloved wife, and one sweet-speaking (of gentle manners), an obedient son, and learning productive of wealth -- these six, o king, are the pleasures of the mortal world. 
[Page 3]
; 003.01
Who will be (considered) blessed by having sons who are like (no better than, the adhakas* (a kind of measure) filling up (** i.e., Simply making up a particular number){;hitoeng003.txt} a granary? It is better to have one son, who is the prop of the family and who brings fame to his father. 
; 003.03
A father who contracts debts (i.e., leaves nothing to his son but a legacy of debt) is an enemy, and so is a mother, false to her bed; a beautiful wife is an enemy; and such is an illiterate son.
; 003.05
Learning if not kept up by constant study is poison ; taking food after indigestion is poison; to a poor man a public assembly is poison; and to an old man a youthful wife is poison.
; 003.07
A man of merits, born of whatever parents, is honoured ; (for) what is the use of a bow that is without string though made of a faultless bamboo staff (or, what can a man of pure Kshatriya extraction do if wanting in martial vigour)?
; 003.09
Alas! poor child, thou, who leadest an easy life, didst not acquire knowledge in these (bygone) nights, on this account dost thou come to grief (fare ill) in the society of the learned like a cow stuck in mud.
; 003.11
Then how shall I now make my sons accomplished ! For: --
; 003.12
Food, sleep, fear and the enjoyment of carnal pleasures -- these men share in common with beasts ; surely the sense (or performance) of duty is their special attribute (distinguishing mark): devoid of this they are degraded to the level of (stand on a level with) beasts.
; 003.14
The life of him, who has not achieved any one of Dharma (the discharge of religious duties), Artha (the acquisition of money by fair means), Kama (the gratification of desires so as not to trespass on Dharma) and final emancipation, is as without its purpose (useless) as that of the nipple on the neck of a she-goat.
; 003.16
Now, (as to) the declaration (doctrine) that -- (The period of) life, (the kinds of) action (one has to perform), (the amount of) wealth (to be acquired), (the degree of) knowledge (to be attained), and (the time of) death -- even these five are created (determined) while a man is yet in the womb. And that,
; 003.18
Things, which are fated, do happen even in the case of the great: (as) Siva's nakedness and Hari's having to sleep on a huge serpent.
; 003.20
 And further . What is not to be can never be, and if it is to be, it can never be otherwise -- why is this antidote against the poison of anxiety not swallowed ? --
{;hitoeng004.txt}
; 003.22
These are the idle words of some, incapable of doing anything.
; 003.23
Even thinking fate to be favourable one should not give up one's industry ; (for) one can never get oil from sesamum without exertion. 
; 003.25
Moreover . Fortune approaches him, the lion among men, who is industrious. It is the weak-minded who say "Fate gives". Dismissing all idea about (lit., killing) fate, put forth manly efforts depending upon your own strength; and if, after an exertion is made, success attend not, where is the blame (i.e., you are not to blame; or, find out where the fault lay)? 
[Page 4]
; 004.01 
 Just as a chariot can not move with one wheel, so without manly exertion, fate does not succeed. 
; 004.03
And further . What is called fate is (but) the (sum of one's) actions in a previous life; one should, therefore, make an effort manfully without being slothful.
; 004.05
Just as a potter makes whatever he likes out of a lump of clay, so does a man reap the fruit of the action done by himself.
; 004.07
Even seeing a treasure found quite by accident in front of a man, fate does not take it up itself, but expects a manly effort of his part.
; 004.09
Works are accomplished by industry and not by (idle) wishes; for the deer enter not the mouth of a sleeping lion.
; 004.11
A boy who is educated by his parents becomes accomplished. A son does not become a learned man by merely being dropped out of the womb.
; 004.13
That mother is an enemy and that father a foe of the son by whom he is not taught; for he (such a son) shines not in an assembly just as a crane does not in the midst of swans.
; 004.15
Men, endowed with beauty and youth and born of a very noble race but deficient in learning, do not shine as (do not) the scentless Kimshuka flowers.
; 004.17
Even a fool, dressed in fine garments, shines in an assembly; but he shines only so long as he does not open his lips. 
; 004.19
Having thus meditated the king convened a council of the learned. The King said -- Ye Pandits, listen. Is there such a learned man among you, as is able to make my sons who are always going astray and who are ignorant of the Sastras, undergo a second birth (as it were) by giving them instruction in the science of conduct? For, {;hitoeng005.txt} 
; 004.22
A piece of glass, by being in contact with gold, possesses the lustre of emerald ; similarly a fool attains proficiency by being in the company of the good. 
; 004.24
It is also said -- The intellect is impaired, O friend, by the society of inferiors; it remains what it is with one's equals and is improved by association with one's superiors.
; 004.26
Then a great Pandit, Visnusharman by name, who knew all the principles of the Science of conduct (or, who knew the very essence of the entire science of conduct) spoke like a second Brihaspati -- My lord, these princes are born of an exalted race. They are, therefore, capable of being instructed by me in the Nitishastra. For,
; 004.28
No action exercised upon an unfit object can bear fruit: a crane cannot be taught (to speak) like a parrot even with hundreds of efforts. 
; 004.30
And this other thing -- In this (royal) family a child devoid of merits cannot be born; whence can a piece of glass be produced in a mine of rubies ? 
[Page 5]
; 005.01
I will, therefore, make your sons well versed in the Nitishastra within the space of six months. The king spoke again respectfully --
; 005.03 
Even an insect ascends the head of the good by being in contact with flowers; a stone also attains divinity when well consecrated by the great. Moreover,
; 005.05
As objects on the rising mountain appear bright by the near presence of the sun, so a person of humble rank too shines by being in the company of the good.
; 005.07
Merits pass as merits with those who know how to appreciate them: coming in contact with one devoid of merits they are turned into faults. Rivers, as they rise, have their water sweet, but on reaching the sea they cease to be drinkable. 
; 005.09
I, therefore, give you Carte blanche as regards giving instruction to my sons in the science of conduct. Having said so the king entrusted his sons to Vishnusharman with great respect.
; 005.11
Thus, the introduction
Acquisition of Friends (Name of first book of Hitopadesha.
; 005.13
Now as the princes were sitting at ease on the terrace of their palace the Pandit said before them by way of introduction --
; 005.14
The wise pass their time in amusement derived from (the study of) poetry and Shastra, while fools pass theirs in vicious pursuits, in sleep or in quarrelling.

;hitoeng006.txt
; 005.16
I will, therefore, relate, for your diversion, the wonderful tale of the crow, the tortoise and others. The princes said -- Sir, tell it. Vishnusharman said -- Listen. I now begin Mitralabha of which the following is the introductory verse.

; 005.18
Though destitute of means and without wealth, the crow, the tortoise, the deer and the mouse, who were the best of friends and gifted with intellect quickly accomplished their purposes.
; 005.20
The princes asked "How was this ?" Vishnusharma related --
; 005.21
There is, on the bank of the Godavari, a large silk-cotton tree. There, coming from regions in different quarters, birds were wont to roost at night. Once, when the night was almost spent, and the divine Moon, lord of the night-lotus, was pending on the crest of the setting mountain, a crow, Laghupatanaka (Swift-flier) by name, who was awake, saw a fowler advancing like a second god of death. Seeing him he reflected "To-day I have had an unwelcome sight in the early morning. I know not what evil it forebodes." Saying so he set out, much disturbed at heart, following up his (the fowler's) course. For,
; 005.26
Thousands of occasions for sorrow, and hundreds for fear, day by day, overtake the fool and not the wise man. 
[Page 6]
; 006.01
 Moreover, worldly people must do this --
; 006.02
Every day on rising, they should think that a great calamity is at hand -- which of death, disease or sorrow would befall (them)! (So that in case of an emergency one should be fore-warned and prepared to meet it).
; 006.04
Now the hunter, having scattered the grains of rice, spread out his net, and himself remained concealed. Just at that time a king of pigeons, Chitragriva (the Speckle-necked) by name, who was sailing in the sky with his retinue, noticed the grains of rice. Then the pigeon-king said to the pigeons that were attracted by the grains of rice -- Whence can there be the possibility of rice-grains being found in this lonely (tenantless) forest? So let the matter be first carefully examined. I do not see any good will come out of this.
Probably, by this our desire for the rice-grains, we too shall fare similarly (meet with a fate similar) to that of --
;hitoeng007.txt
; 006.11
The traveller, who through the lust of a bracelet, sank in deep mire and being caught by an old tiger, lost his life.
; 006.13
The pigeons asked how it was ; whereupon he related --
FABLE 1. 
; 006.15
Once while roaming in the southern forest I saw -- A certain old tiger, having bathed and taken Kusa grass in his paw, used to address (the passers by sitting) on the margin of a lake (thus) -- "Ho, ho, travellers, take this gold bracelet." Then a certain traveller, attracted by greed, thought to himself -- This happens by good luck. But I must not proceed in a matter where there is personal risk. For,
; 006.20
Although a desired object be obtained from an undesirable source, the result is not good ; even nectar (or sweet-food), which is contaminated with poison, leads to death.
; 006.22
But an attempt to get wealth is in every case, attended with peril. And it is said in connection with this --
; 006.23
Without embarking upon an adventure a man does not see good fortune ; but if he does embark upon it and lives (survives it), he sees it.
; 006.25
Let me therefore carefully see it. He said aloud -- "Where is thy bracelet?" The tiger stretched forth bis paw and showed it. The traveller said - How am I to trust thee who art ferocious ? The tiger replied -- Listen, O traveller. Formerly, indeed, in the days of youth, I was extremely wicked. On account of my slaughter of many a cow and man, my sons and wife perished ; and I am without issue. I was then advised by a holy man to practice charity and do such other holy deeds. Following his counsel, I am now in the habit of bathing and giving gifts ; I am old and have lost my nails and teeth ; how can I not be an object of confidence then! For, 
[Page 7]
; 007.01
 Sacrificing, studying one's prescribed portion (of the Vedas), charity, penance, truthfulness, patience, forgiveness and freedom from avarice -- this is the eightfold way of doing religious duties as laid down in the Smritis. 
; 007.03
Out of these the first four may be practised even for display, while the last four are found in the magnanimous-hearted only.
; 007.05
And so great is my freedom from desire, that I wish to give away, to any body whatsoever, the gold bracelet although secure in my hand. Yet the (indescriminate) talk of the people {;hitoeng008.txt} that a tiger eats men is difficult to be avoided (lit., warded off). For,
; 007.08
People, who are the blind followers of one another, regard not a preaching bawd as an authority in religious matters, as they do a Brahmana although (he happens to be) a cow-killer.
; 007.10
I, on my part, have studied the codes of religious law. Hear me.
; 007.11
O son of Pandu, as is a shower of rain to the Maru (desert) land, or food to one afflicted with hunger, so is a gift to the poor, full of fruit.
; 007.13
As life is dear to oneself so it is to (other) creatures. The good show pity to creatures by comparing (them) to themselves. 
; 007.15
Moreover. In refusing and giving, in pleasure and pain, and in things (or acts) agreeable and disagreeable, a man knows the standard (of action) by self-comparison. 
; 007.17
Also. He, who looks upon another's wife as a mother, another's wealth as a clod of earth, and upon all creatures as his own self, is a (truly) wise man.
; 007.19
You are in hard distress (lit., extremely ill-situated) and hence I am endeavouring to give it to you.
; 007.20
Enrich the poor, O son of Kunti ; bestow not wealth upon the rich; medicine is wholesome to him who is diseased; what need of medicine has he that is whole ? 
; 007.22
And again. A gift, which is given for the sake of charity, to one who is not a benefactor (or who cannot make a return for it), and in the proper place, at the proper time and to a proper recipient is, (the sages) consider, a gift of the best sort.
; 007.24
Therefore, bathe in this lake and accept this gold bracelet. Thereupon, placing confidence in his words, no sooner did the traveller enter the lake for bathing than he stuck in deep mud and was unable to run away. The tiger seeing him plunged into the mire said -- Ha, thou art fallen into deep mud. I will lift thee out of it. Saying so he approached him gently : and the traveller being seized by the tiger reflected --
; 007.29
That he reads the texts of religious law or studies the Vedas, is no reason why confidence should be reposed in a villain : it is the nature that predominate in such a case : just as by nature the milk of cows is sweet.

;hitoeng009.txt
; 007.33
Also, the actions of those, whose senses and mind are not under control, are like the bath of an elephant;* knowledge without action is a burden, like feeding an ill-natured (lit. unlucky) woman or like ornaments on an ugly woman.
* Which is useless as the animal is sure to cover his body the next moment with mud.
[Page 8]
; 008.01
I, therefore, did not do well in that I placed confidence in this ferocious beast. For, says the precept --
; 008.03
Trust should never be placed in rivers, in persons having weapons in their hands, in animals armed with claws, and horns, as well as in women and royal families.** 
** (As far as [third-sic] their favour is concerned).
; 008.05
Again. It is the natural disposition of every one that is tested, and not his other qualities; for having surpassed all (other) qualities, disposition stands at the head. And further,
; 008.07
 That well-known sporter in the sky, the destroyer of sin (darkness), possessor of a thousand rays (bands), and marching in the midst of the stars, even he, the Moon, is devoured (eclipsed) by Rahu, by the decree of fate: who is able to efface what is written on the forehead ? 
; 008.11
While thus musing he was killed by the tiger, and eaten.
; 
Therefore I say "Through the last of a bracelet &c." For this reason nothing rash should at all be done. For,
; 008.14
Food well digested, a son very wise (well educated), a wife well disciplined, a king served faithfully, what is spoken after being well thought over and what is done after due consideration -- these do not lead to a bad result even after a very long time.
; 008.18
On hearing these words a certain pigeon said arrogantly -- Ah, why is it so said ?
; 008.20
The words (counsel) of the aged should be acted upon (followed) only when the time of calamity is at hand : if we consider thus in all matters, we can hardly proceed to take our food. 
; 008.22
For. Everything on the surface of the earth, food and drink, is involved in doubt: to what should an attempt be directed and how should life be supported ?
; 008.24
One who is envious, one given to reviling, one (ever) discontented, one who is irascible and one who is always suspicious , one who lives upon another's fortune# -- these six have misery for their lot.
# Kale forgot this last of the 6; translation from MW dictionary for 'paraBAgyopajIvin'.
;hitoeng010.txt
; 008.26
On hearing this the pigeons alighted on (the grains ). For,
; 008.27
Even those, who are masters of the great Shastras, well-informed, and able to remove doubts, experience trouble when (their judgment is) blinded by avarice. 
; 008.29
Again -- From greed proceeds disquietude, from greed springs up the desire (for pleasures), and from greed result infatuation and (finally) ruin; greed is the root of sin.
; 008.31
And again. The existence of a gold deer was impossible and yet Rama coveted (such) a deer; as a general rule when (some) calamity is impending the talents of men become clouded. 
[Page 9]
; 009.01 
After that they were all caught in the net. Then all of them began to revile him, by whose advice they had descended there. For,
; 009.03
One should not go at the head of (lead) a multitude; if the undertaking succeeds, the fruit is the same to (equally shared by) all; but if it fails, the leader is killed. 
; 009.05
Hearing how he was reproached, Chitragriva said -- It is not his fault. For,
; 009.06
Of misfortunes about to befall, even a friend becomes the cause: when a calf is to be tied down the leg of the mother serves as a post.
; 009.08
He is a friend of the afflicted who is able to deliver them from misery, and not he, who is clever (only) in condemning a thing ill done or omitted to be done. (With the reading न तु भीत -- clever in finding fault with the manner of protecting the distressed.)
; 009.10 
In the time of adversity, perplexity itself is the sign of a weak-minded man. Therefore, taking courage in this case, think out a remedy. For,
; 009.12 
Fortitude in adversity and again forbearance in prosperity, eloquence in an assembly and valour on the battle-field, a liking for fame (good name) and a strong attachment to study -- these are the natural possessions of the magnanimous.
; 009.14
A mother rarely gives birth to a son, an ornament of the three worlds, who does not rejoice in prosperity or feel sorrow in adversity and is firm in battle. Moreover,
; 009.16
A man, wishing for welfare in this world, should avoid these six faults ; viz., sleepiness, slothfulness, timidity, anger, idleness and dilatoriness.
;hitoeng011.txt
; 009.18
Even now let this be done. Let us all, being of one mind, fly away with the net. For,
; 009.19
The union of even small things leads to the accomplishment of an object ; infuriated (rutting) elephants are tied down by means of grass twisted (made) into a rope.
; 009.21
Union with the members of their family, although insignificant, is for the good of men ; rice stripped of even its husk will not grow.
; 009.23
The birds, having thus taken counsel, flew up all with the net. Thereupon the fowler, seeing them, from afar, carrying off the net, and running after them, thought to himself,
; 009.25
These birds, being combined, are bearing away my net ; but when they will fall down (or, out among themselves), they will fall into my power. 
[Page 10]
; 010.01
Then, when the birds bad passed beyond the range of the eye, the fowler returned. Now the pigeons, seeing that the fowler had turned back, said -- What is proper to be done now? Chitragriva said --
; 010.05
A mother, a friend and a father -- these three are naturally friendly ; others are well-disposed according to the law of cause and effect.
; 010.07
Now our friend, Hiranyaka by name, the king of mice, dwells in Chitravana (a beautiful forest) on the bank of the Gandaki. He will cut off our bonds. Having thus deliberated, they all went to the hole of Hiranyaka. Hiranyaka, on his part, always apprehensive of danger, had made a burrow with a hundred passages and lived in it. Then Hiranyaka, startled with fear at the descent of the pigeons, stood silent. Chitragriva said -- Dear Hiranyaka, why don't you talk to us? Then Hiranyaka, having recognised his voice, rushed out in haste and said -- Ah, happy am I! my beloved friend Chitragriva has come.
; 010.16
No one is more meritorious in this world than he, who talks with his friend, who lives with his friend and who holds a friendly discourse (or, chats) with his friend.
; 010.18
Seeing them caught in the snares he stood astonished for a moment and said -- Friend, what is this ? Chitragriva replied -- Friend, this is the fruit of our deeds in a previous life.
; 010.22
From whatever cause, by whatever means, in whatever manner, at whatever time, of whatever kind, in whatever proportion and at whatever place, one may do a deed, good or {;hitoeng012.txt} bad, one reaps the fruit of it, in obedience to the will of providence, from that cause, by that means, &c.
; 010.26
Disease, sorrow, affliction, restraint and calamities -- these are the fruits of the trees in the form of the faults committed by men.
; 010.28
The mouse quickly proceeded to sever the bonds of Chitragriva. Chirtagriva said -- Friend, do not do so; first cut the bonds of these my followers ; and then you will cut mine. Hiranyaka too replied -- I have little strength and my teeth are delicate, how then can I gnaw asunder the snares of these all? So as long as my teeth are not broken, I will cut your bonds and then sever those of the rest too as far as my strength will allow. Chitragriva said -- Be it so; but cut the bonds of these to the best of your strength. Hiranyaka replied -- The protection of dependents at the cost of one's life is not approved of by those conversant with the science of conduct (or, policy). For,
; 010.39
One should save money (as a provision) against the time of trouble, save one's wife even at the expense of wealth and save one's own self even at the cost of one's wife and wealth. 
[Page 11]
; 011.01
Another consideration is -- Life is the cause of the proper maintenance of Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha. *{* See. p. 3, 11, 23-26.} What does he not deprive himself of who deprives himself of it, or what does he not save who saves it?
; 011.03
Chitragriva said -- Friend, as for (the principle of) Policy it is such, indeed! But I am not, at all, able to bear the affliction of these my followers (lit., protegees). Hence I say this. For,
; 011.06
A wise man should give up his wealth and also his life for another's sake; their abandonment in a good cause is desirable as destruction is certain.
; 011.08
And this is another special reason.
; 011.09
They bear an equality to me as regards kind, substance and qualities : say then, when and what will be the fruit of my being their lord ?
Also,
; 011.11
Even without wages they do not leave my side (forsake me); therefore, save these my dependents, even at the sacrifice of my life. 
;hitoeng013.txt
; 011.13
Moreover. Giving up all regard for this perishable body which is made of flesh, urine, ordure, and bones, save my reputation, 0, friend. 
; 011.15
See. If lasting and unsullied fame be gained at the expense of the body which is perishable and a vehicle of dirt, what would not be gained ? 
; 011.17
For. Very great is the distance that separates the body from the qualities: the body is liable to destruction in a moment, while the qualities endure to the end of the universe.
; 011.19 
Having heard this, Hiranyaka, being delighted at heart and with his hair standing on end, said -- Noble, friend, noble ! By this your affection for your followers, you deserve the sovereignty of even the three worlds. With these words, he cut off the bonds of them all. Then Hiranyaka, having cordially received all, said -- Dear Chitragriva, in regard to this your being caught in a net you should not blame yourself by suspecting any fault on your part. For,
; 011.24
That very bird, who sees his prey from a distance of more than a hundred yojanas, sees not the snares (laid for him) when his time has arrived. Moreover, 
; 011.26
When I behold the oppression of the moon and the sun by the monsters (Rahu and Ketu), the imprisonment of even the elephant and the cobra, and the poverty of the talented, I come to think -- Fate, alas, is powerful! 
; 011.28
And again. Even birds moving (or, sporting) in a part of (or exclusively in) the sky meet with calamity; and the fishes, too, are caught by experts from the sea with its unfathomable waters; so what is an evil act or a good one in this world, or of what avail is a position of advantage ? For, the god of destruction, with his hand in the form of a calamity stretched forth, seizes even from afar. 
[Page 12]
; 012.01
Having thus enlightened him, he entertained him hospitably, embraced him and dismissed him to go; whereupon Chitragriva, with his attendant train, went to the regions he liked to go to. Hiranyaka too entered his burrow.
; 012.04
One should make hundreds of friends, of whatever description they may be: behold, the pigeons were released from bonds by their friend, the mouse.
; 012.06
Now the crow Laghupatanaka, the witness of the whole affair, said this in astonishment: Ho, Hiranyaka, you are {;hitoeng014.txt} praiseworthy. I, therefore, desire friendship with you. Kindly then favour me with your friendship. On hearing this, Hiranyaka asked from within his hole -- who are you? He said I am a crow, Laghupatanaka by name. Hiranyaka smilingly observed -- What friendship can there be with you ? For,
; 012.13
Whatever is fit to be united with another, in this world, the same a wise man should unite with that: I am the food and you the feeder: how can love (friendship) exist between us?
; 012.15 
 And again. Friendship between the food and its eater is simply the cause of misfortune: the deer that was caught in a snare, through (the stratagem of) a jackal was delivered by a crow. 
; 012.17
The crow asked -- How was that ? Hiranyaka related -- :
FABLE II. 
; 012.20
There is, in the country of Magadha, a vast wilderness, called Champakavati. In it there long lived in great friendship a deer and a crow. The deer, plump and sleek in body, was spied by a certain jackal, while roaming at will. On seeing him, the jackal said to himself -- Ah, how shall I come by his delicious flesh ! Well, let me first create confidence (in him). Having thus reflected, he went up to him and said -- Friend, is it all well with you? The dear asked -- Who are you? He replied -- I am a jackal, Kshudrabuddhi (Little-wit) by name. I live here, like one dead, having lost all my relatives. Now that I have found a friend in you and have (thus) a relative, I have once more entered the world of the living. Now I will, in every way, be your attendant. The deer said -- Be it so. Thereafter, when the divine Sun, the wearer of a wreath of rays, had set, the two went to the residence of the deer. There on the branch of a Champaka tree, lived a crow, named Subuddbi (Good-wit), an old friend of the deer. Seeing the two the crow asked -- Friend, who is this second ? The deer said -- This is a jackal who comes here desiring our friendship. The crow said, friend, friendship, all of a sudden, with a stranger, is not advisable. For it is said -- 
; 012.37
Shelter should not be given to any one whose family and disposition are not known; for the fault of a cat, the vulture, Jaradgava, suffered death.
; 012.39
The two asked how it was, whereupon the crow related --
FABLE III. 
; 012.43
There is a large Parkati tree on the hill, named Gridhrakut (the peak of Vultures), on the bank of the Bhagirathi, {;hitoeng015.txt} In its hollow dwelt, with his talons and eyes gone through an adverse turn of fate, a vulture, Jaradgava by name. Now, out of pity, the birds, roosting in the tree, spared small portions from their food and gave them to him. He lived on that.
; 013.01
He looked after the young birds. Now, once a cat, named Dirghakarna (the long-eared) came there to eat the youngs of the birds. Seeing him coming, the nestlings being terror-stricken, raised a cry. Hearing it Jaradgava asked -- Who is this that is coming? Dirghakarna, seeing the vulture, said in alarm -- Alas, it is all up with me. However,
; 013.06
One should dread a danger only as long as it has not arrived; but seeing that the danger has come, a man should do what the occasion demands.
; 013.08
Now that I am in his presence, I cannot run away. So let things take what course they may. I will first create confidence in him and then approach him. Thus resolved, he went forth and said -- Sir, I salute you. The Vulture asked -- Who are you? He replied -- A cat. The Vulture said -- Get away, else I shall have to kill you. The cat said -- In the first place, hear me, and then, if you deem me to be worthy of death, let me not live. For,
; 013.16 
Is any one killed or honoured merely because he belongs to a particular caste? It is only on one's actions (conduct) being fully known that one is found fit to merit death or respect.
; 
The Vulture said –- Explain why you have come here. The cat replied -- I dwell here on the bank of the Ganges, bathing every day, living a life of celibacy and practising the vow of Chandrayana. All birds, worthy of confidence, always declare before me that you are devoted to the study of religious law. Hence did I come here to hear from you, who are advanced both in knowledge and years (lit. old both as regards knowledge and age), the holy law. But your honour is so well versed in that law that you are ready to kill me, a guest. While the duty of a house-holder is this --
; 013.25
Fitting hospitality should be shown even to a foe coming to the house: the tree withdraws not its shade from its cutter.
; 013.27
And if there be no wealth, a guest should be honoured with kind words at least. For,
; 013.28
Grass (a seat made of grass), place, water and the fourth (thing), agreeable speech, these, at any rate, are never refused in the house of the good. Moreover, 
;hitoeng016.txt
; 013.30
The good show pity even to creatures devoid of merits: the moon does not, indeed, withhold her light from the pariah's residence. 
; 013.32
Also. Fire is the object of worship to the twice-born (Brahmanas), and the Brahmana to the (four) castes; the husband is the only object of adoration to his wife, while a guest is the object of reverence everywhere. 
[Page 14]
; 014.01
 When a guest turns back from a man's house, disappointed in his hopes, he does so, having transferred his sin to him and taken his merit with him. 
; 014.03
And again. Even a low-born person, coming to the house of one of a high caste, should be honoured as he deserves ; (for) a guest represents in himself all the gods.
; 014.05
The vulture said –- The cat is fond of flesh; and the youngs of birds live here: therefore, I say so. The cat, on hearing this, touched the ground and then his ears and said I having learnt the code of religious ordinances and being free from passion have undertaken this arduous vow of the Moon. Although the religious texts disagree with one another (in other respects) they are quite at one in this that abstinence from killing is the highest religious duty. For,
; 014.11
Those men, who are averse to all sort of killing, who bear all things and who are the refuge of all, go to heaven.
; 014.13
Religious merit is the only friend who follows one even in death: everything else goes to destruction along with the body. 
; 014.15
Moreover. When one eats the flesh of another, mark the difference between the two -- the one enjoys momentary pleasure; while the other loses his life. Besides,
; 014.17
The agony that a man suffers, at the thought that he has to die, cannot be described by another by guessing. Hear me again,
; 014.19
Who will commit great sin for this accursed belly when it can be filled with herbs growing spontaneously in the forest?
; 014.21
Having thus inspired confidence (in the vulture) the cat abode in the hollow of the tree.
Thereafter, as days passed on, he attacked the young birds, brought them into the hollow and devoured them every day. (Now) an inquiry was set on foot by those birds whose young nestlings were eaten and who being sorrow-stricken were {;hitoeng017.txt} lamenting. On perceiving this, the cat slipped out of the hollow and escaped. After that, the birds, who were making a close search here and there, discovered the bones of their nestling in the hollow of the tree. Then all the birds having come to the conclusion - our young ones have been eaten by this very Jaradgava -- put him to death. Therefore, I say -- "To one of unknown family and disposition &c." On hearing this the jackal said angrily -- On the day the deer saw you first, your honour too was one whose family and disposition were not known. How comes it then that this friendly behaviour towards you is gaining strength day by day?
; 014.32
Where there is absence of learned men, even a man of little intellect is lauded ; in a country destitute of trees even the castor-oil plant stands out as a tree.
[Page 15]
; 015.01
 Also, This is mine : this is a stranger -- such is the counting of the little-minded : while to the large-minded the whole world is their family.
;  015.03
Just as the deer is my friend, so are you too. The deer said -- What is the use of this altercation? Let us all live happily together in friendly discourse. For,
;  015.06
No one is anybody's friend or anybody's foe: it is the behaviour (or, intercourse) that makes friends or foes.
; 015.08
The crow said -- Be it so. Then in the morning, they all went to places where their will led them. Once the jackal said to the deer in solitude -- Friend, in a corner of this wood there is a field full of corn. I shall take you there and show it to you. That being done, the deer went there every day and ate the corn. Now, the master of the field observed this and set a snare. Then the deer going there again was caught into the snare; whereapon he reflected -- Who but a friend can deliver me from the hunter's snare as from the snare of Death? Presently the jackal came up and standing near reflected -- As to the success of my wish, it has borne fruit by my well-arranged scheme. When he will be cut up, I am sure to get his bones covered with flesh and blood which will serve me as food plentifully. The deer, delighted at his sight, said, Friend, cut my bonds at once ; quickly save me. For,
; 015.22
One should know (the sincerity of) a friend in calamities, a warrior in battle, an honest man when in debt, a wife when fortune declines and relatives in difficulties. 
;hitoeng018.txt
; 015.24
Also. He is a kinsman who stands (by one) in joy as well as in misery, when there is a famine or when a kingdom is overthrown, at the royal gate or in a cemetery.
; 
The Jackal having again and again looked at the net, thought to himself -- As for this net it is very strong; and said -- Friend, these snares are made of sinews. How then, can I touch these with my teeth to-day, it being Sunday ? Friend, if you will not think otherwise (i.e. will not have any misconception about me) tomorrow morning I will do whatever you will bid me do. With these words, he concealed himself near him and remained (waiting). Afterwards the crow, seeing that the deer did not return in the evening, looked for him here and there, and having discovered him in that condition, said -- Friend, what is this? The deer replied –- This is the result of my disregard of a friend's advice. For, it is said
; 015.33
Adversity stands close to him who listens not to the words of well-meaning friends: such a man is the delight of his enemies.
; 015.35
The crow asked -- Where is that traitor? The deer said -- Desirous of my flesh he waits just here. The crow said I had already said (as much).
; 015.38
"I have committed no fault" -- this is no reason for putting confidence (in a wicked man) : for, even the meritorious have fear from the wicked.
; 015.40
Those, whose life has ended, perceive not the smell of an extinguished lamp, listen not to the words of a friend, and see not the star Arundhati. 
[Page 16] 
; 016.01
He who defeats one's object in one's absence and speaks sweetly in one's presence -- such a friend one should avoid, like a vessel full of poison with milk at the surface.
; 016.03
Then the crow, having heaved a deep sigh, said -- Ah villain, what hast thou done in acting so wickedly ? For,
; 016.05
What (glory or credit) is there in deceiving supplicants, in this world, who are made to converse (with you) by using sweet words, who are won over by false attentions, and who (thereby) entertain hopes and have placed confidence in you)?
; 016.07
O divine Earth, how dost thou bear (on thy surface) that man, treacherous to his promise, who practises evil upon a benevolent, unsuspecting (lit., full of confidence) and simple-hearted person ?
;hitoeng019.txt
; 016.09
One should not form friendship or feel affection for a wicked man: a charcoal, when alive, burns; when cold, it soils the hand.
; 016.11
Or rather, such is the settled course of conduct of the wicked.
; 016.12
First he falls at the feet and then bites the back; gradually he sings wonderfully some sweet indistinct hum into the ear; and having noticed some hole (a weak point) he at once enters it (takes advantage of it) fearlessly : -(thus) does a gnat imitate all the actions of wicked man.
; 016.16
That a wicked man speaks sweetly is no reason why confidence should be reposed in him : (for) on the tip of his tongue there is honey, but in his heart the deadliest poison.
; 016.18
Then at dawn, the crow observed the owner of the field coming towards the place, stick in hand. On seeing him the crow said -- Friend deer, feign yourself dead, fill your belly with wind and so remain, with your legs stiffened. When I make a noise, you shall get up and bound off quickly. Following the advice of the crow, the deer stood in that posture. Now the master of the field saw the deer in that condition, his eyes beaming with joy. Saying "Ah, thou art dead of thyself", he released him from confinement and was busied in collecting his nets. Then hearing the sound of the crow, the deer quickly got up and ran away, while the jackal was killed by the stick flung at him (the deer) by the owner of the field. For it is said
; 016.28
In three years, or three months, or three fortnights, or (even) in three days, a man reaps the fruit of his good or bad actions when reaching their extreme.
; 016.30
Hence I say "Friendship between the victim and the eater etc." The crow observed again,
; 016.32
Even though I eat you I shall not get ample food; but if you live, I live, O sinless one, like Chitragriva. 
; 016.34
Again. Confidence (in one another) is observed even amongst those lower animals whose actions are invariably (wholly) good : for the disposition of the good ever remains true to (lit. does not vary from) their inborn goodness. 
; 016.36
Moreover. The mind of a good man, although made to fly into a great passion, is not affected (by anger); it is not possible to heat the water of the sea with a torch of straw. 
;hitoeng020.txt
[Page 17]
; 017.01
Hiranyaka said -- You are fickle-minded (or, mischievous); and, with the fickle-minded, friendship should not at all be formed. For it is said .
; 017.03
A cat, a buffalo, a ram, a crow, and a bad man -- these get the upper hand (get the better of as) through confidence : confidence in them is out of place (lit. it is not proper to put trust in them).
; 017.05
Another consideration is this -- you belong to the side of our enemies. And thus says the precept --
; 017.06
One should not make peace with an enemy even by a compactly-formed treaty: water, although greatly heated, does extinguish fire. Nevertheless,
; 017.08
A wicked man should be shunned although he be adorned with learning; the cobra is decked with a gem : but is he not dreadful?
; 017.10
What is impossible can never be possible; and what is possible is certainly possible: a cart cannot move on water nor can a boat on land. 
; 017.12
Moreover. He, who, depending upon the strength of wealth (given to or by his enemies), although great, trusts to his enemies or to wives that have ceased to love him, finds his life end there.
; 017.14
Laghupatanaka said I have heard everything. Yet I am thus far resolved that I must necessarily form friendship with you: or else I will destroy myself by starvation. For,
; 017.17
(Friendship with) a bad man, like a vessel of earth, is easily broken and cemented with difficulty; while (that with) a good man is like a pot of gold, difficult to be broken and easily re-united. 
; 017.19
Moreover. The union of metals is due to their fluxibility, of beasts and birds to some cause, of fools to fear or (the prospect of) gain, while of good men to (mere) sight. 
; 017.21
Also. Friends appear to be of the form of coconuts (rough and rugged to outward appearance but sweet at heart): others are like jujubes -- attractive from outside only.
; 017.23
Although friendship be at an end, the qualities (behaviour) of good men suffer no change: even when lotus-stalks are broken, the fibres remain sticking (to them) yet. 
; 017.25
And again. Purity (of purpose), generosity, courage, sameness of behaviour in pleasure or pain, politeness, affection and truthfulness -- those are the characteristics of a (true) friend.
;hitoeng021.txt
; 017.27
And what other friend than yourself, endowed with these qualities, can I find ? Hearing these his words and such others, Hiranyaka stepped out and said --
; 
I am exhilarated by this nectar of your speech (lit. I am fattened by you by &c.); as it is observed :
; 017.30
Not a bath with very cool water, not a necklace of pearls, not (even) sandal-wood-pigment applied to each and every limb, delights a man, oppressed with heat, so much, as the words of the good, uttered with affection, advanced with wise arguments (or full of wise thoughts) and comparable to (fascinating like) the charm of attraction, have power over (are able to gratify) the mind of the virtuous. 
[Page 18]
; 018.01
Again.  Divulging a secret, begging, hard-heartedness, fickleness of mind, anger, faithlessness and gambling --these are the faults in a friend.
; 018.03
Following the order of (the faults mentioned in) this speech, not a single fault is found in you. For,
; 018.05
Cleverness and truthfulness are known in the course of conversation; while activity and absence of rashness are known from actual experience.
; 018.06
 Moreover. Of quite a different sort (from that of a deceitful person) is the friendship of one whose mind is pure: while quite in a different direction (from real action) proceed the words of one whose mind is affected with deceit.
; 018.08
There is one thing in mind, another in speech and a third in deed of the vile-minded, while there is one thing in mind, the same in speech and the same in action of the magnanimous.
; 018.10
Therefore let your wish be done. Having said so, Hiranyaka formed friendship with the crow, pleased him with choice eatables and entered his hole. The crow, too, repaired to his residence. Thenceforward the two passed their time in making presents of food to each other, in inquiries after good health and in confidential discourses.
; 018.14
Once Laghupatanaka said to Hiranyaka -- Friend, it is very hard to get food in this place. I wish, therefore, to go to some other place. Hiranyaka said  -- Where can we go to? For it is said .
; 018.18
A talented man walks with one foot, and stops with the other: one should not leave one's old abode without examining carefully the new one.
;hitoeng022.txt
; 018.20
The crow said –- There is a place well examined. Hiranyaka asked -- 'Which is that?' The crow replied: There is a lake called Karparagaura in the Dandaka forest. There dwells a pious tortoise, who is my dear friend, acquired a long while ago. For,
; 018.25
To be wise in giving advice to others is a thing very easy for all to do; but to be true to the discharge of one's proper duties (or, to discharge one's duties as required by religion) belongs to some magnanimous soul (only). He will entertain me with choice dainties. Hiranyaka too said -- And what am I to do by staying here? For,
; 018.29
One should abandon that country in which one cannot command respect, has no means of livelihood, no relatives, and no (possibility) of acquiring knowledge of any kind. 
; 018.31
Also. One should not reside in a country where there is a lack of these five, viz., subsistence, dread (of authority ), sense of shame, politeness, and charitableness.
; 
One should not dwell there, O friend, where these four things do not exist, viz., a creditor, a physician, a Brahmana versed in the Vedas and a river with water (ever flowing).
; 018.35
Therefore, take me there too.  Then the crow arrived at the lake with ease conversing on diverse subjects with that friend of his. Then Manthara, having seen them from a distance, addressed a fitting welcome to Laghupatanaka and received the mouse with hospitality due to a guest. For,
; 018.40
Let a boy or an old man or a young man come to the house, respect should be shown to him; a guest is the object of worship everywhere. 
[Page 19]
; 019.01
The crow said -- Friend Manthara, do him special honour. For he is the king of mice, Hiranyaka by name, foremost of those whose actions are meritorious and an ocean of mercy. The king of serpents, aided by his twice thousand tongues even, will not be able to sing the praise of his merits. Having said so he described the episode about Chitragriva. Manthara having respectfully entertained Hiranyaka said -- Good friend, kindly relate the cause of your coming to a dreary wood. Hiranyaka said--I will; may you listen. 
FABLE IV. 
; 019.07
There is a convent of recluses in the city of Champaka. In it dwelt a hermit, Chudakarna by name. He was in the habit of sleeping after having hung on a peg his alms-pot, containing {;hitoeng023.txt} the remnant of the food collected by begging after he had eaten of it. I used every day to leap up and eat that food. After some time a dear friend of his, Vinakarna by name, a hermit, came there. While engaged in conversation with him Chudakarna kept beating the ground with an old bamboo stick. Vinakarna said -- Friend, why do you take no interest in my story and are busy with something else? Chudakarna replied -- Friend, not that I am indifferent (to your conversation ), but look at this mouse, doing wrong to me, who by jumping up always eats the food collected by me by begging and placed in that pot. Vinakarna, having looked at the peg, observed -- How can a mouse, possessed of little strength, jump to such a height? There must be some reason for this. For it is said --
; 019.16
The young wife, having suddenly drawn her old husband by the hair, kissed him with a close embrace; there must be some reason for this.
; 019.18
Chudakarna demanded how it was, whereupon Vinakarna related --
FABLE V.
; 019.20
There is, in the country of Gauda, a city, Kausambi by name. In it dwelt a merchant of great wealth, Chandanadasa by name. Although in the decline of age, he through the pride of wealth, and his mind being full of passion, married merchant's daughter, Lilavati by name. She attained youth, looking like the victorious banner of the god of love; while that aged husband did not please her. For,
; 019.24
The heart of women delights not in a husband whose limbs are worn out by old age, as does not that of men pinched with cold in the (rays of the) moon, or that of men oppressed with heat in the sun. 
; 019.26
Moreover. What passion can men have, when the hair even is turned grey, since women, whose heart is set on others, regard it as medicine? 
; 019.28
However, that old husband had a very great affection for her.
; 019.29
The lust of wealth and the desire for life of men is ever great; but to an old man a youthful wife is dearer than his life.
; 019.31
An old man is not able to enjoy pleasures or to abandon them either: as a dog without teeth simply licks a bone with his tongue (but does not throw it off).
;hitoeng024.txt
; 019.33
Now that Lilavati, transgressing the bounds of family honour through flush of youth, became attached to a certain merchant's son. For, 
[Page 20]
; 020.01
(Unrestrained ) liberty, residence in the father's house (after the consummation of marriage), meeting with persons on occasions of festive gatherings, a loose living in the vicinity of men, meeting in a company, dwelling in a foreign country, association with women of bad character, constant violation of one's proper conduct, the old age of the husband or his jealousy or his absence in a foreign land--these are the causes of the ruin of a woman's character. 
; 020.05
Moreover. Drinking, the company of bad men, separation from the husband, rambling about wantonly, and sleeping and residing in another's house - these six spoil a woman.
* * * * 
; 020.09
Moreover. There is no (suitable) place, or leisure or a suitor; it is on account of this that women remain chaste.
; 020.11
Women are ever inconstant, as it is well known even to the gods: happy are those by whom even such are guarded.
; 020.13
There is none who is disagreeable to women; nor is there one who is loved by them; they ever seek a fresh man, as cows do grass in a forest. 
; 020.15
Again. A woman resembles a pot of ghee, while a man is like live charcoal: a wise man should not, therefore, keep together the two. 
; 020.17
Not modesty, not good breeding, not rectitude, not timidity, but absence of a suit is the cause of a woman's chastity.
; 020.19
The father guards a woman in childhood, the husband in youth and the son in old age: a woman is not allowed liberty (in any case ).
; 020.21
Once, as that Lilavati was sitting at ease on a couch fringed with the rays of a series of gems, engaged in a confidential talk with the merchant's son, she beheld her husband come there unexpectedly, when, rising quickly, she pulled him by the hair, closely embraced him and kissed him. In the meanwhile, the gallant made his escape. It is said --
; 020.24
The Sastra which Usanas ever knew, as also that which Brihaspati knew, -- all that is well planted in the talent of a woman.
;hitoeng025.txt
; 020.26
Seeing that embrace a procuress that stood by said to herself "She has embraced him all of a sudden!" Then that procuress, having ascertained the cause, punished that Lilavati with a secret fine. Hence I say 'The youthful wife having suddenly seized her old husband &c.' There must be some cause in this case which keeps up the strength of this mouse. After a moment's thought the recluse said -- And the cause must be abundance of money. For,
; 020.31
In this world every man of wealth is, everywhere and at all times, powerful; even the supreme power of kings has wealth for its cause.
[Page 21]
021.01
Then he took a spade and having dug out my burrow, took away my long-hoarded wealth. Thenceforward, deprived of my strength, without spirit and energy, and unable to earn even my own food, I was observed by Chudakarna, moving along slowly and with trepidation. Then he observed --
; 021.05
In this world a man becomes powerful by wealth, and by wealth also he becomes (is considered) learned. Look at this wicked mouse reduced to the level of his kind. 
; 021.07
Moreover. All the actions of a man of little intellect, if void of wealth, die away (prove fruitless) like small streams in summer.
; 021.09
Again. He who has wealth has friends; he who has wealth has kinsmen; he who has wealth is a man in this world, and he who has wealth is a learned man. 
; 021.11
Also. The house of the sonless is void, and so is of one who has no good friend; all the quarters are void to a fool, but all is void to poverty. 
; 021.12
And again. His limbs uninjured are the same; his name is the same ; his intellect unimpaired is the same; his words the same; and the man also the same; and yet, when deprived of the warmth of money, he becomes quite a different man in a moment; this is strange!
; 021.16
Having heard all this I thought to myself:--Now my residence here is improper; and as to my communicating this matter to another, that too is not proper. For,
; 021.18
A wise man should not give out the loss of wealth, mental anxiety, the misdeeds in the house, his being deceived and his humiliation. 
;hitoeng026.txt
; 021.20
Moreover. (The period of) life, (the amount of) wealth, a family secret, charms, conjugal enjoyment, medicine, penance, charity and one's disgrace--these nine things should be carefully concealed.
; 021.22
And so it is said -- When fate is extremely adverse, and exertions and valour have been of no avail, where, except in a wilderness, can a highminded man, reduced to poverty, find relief? 
; 021.24
Moreover. A man of self-respect will rather die than stoop to meanness (act meanly): fire will even suffer extinction, but never become cool. 
; 021.26
Moreover. The course of action of a wise man, like that of a bunch of flowers, is twofold, viz., either to stand at (on) the head of all, or to die (wither) away in a forest.
; 021.28
And as to living here on alms, that would be exceedingly despicable. For,
; 021.20
It were better for a poor man to satisfy fire with his life than to solicit a mean person, lost to all civility.
; 021.31
From poverty a man comes to have shame : overwhelmed with shame he loses moral fortitude: with his moral fortitude lost he suffers contempt; being contemned he feels dejected: full of dejection he comes to sorrow; when overcome with sorrow he is forsaken by reason; with his reason gone, he passes on to destruction: Want of wealth, alas, is the abode of all misfortunes !! 
; 
Again. Better is silence observed than an untrue word spoken : better is impotency for men than intercourse with another's wife: 
[Page 22]
; 022.01
Better to abandon life than to have a liking for the words of the wicked; better to live on alms than to have the happiness of enjoying another's wealth.
; 022.03
Better to have an empty cow-pen than a naughty ox; better to have a courtesan for wife than an immodest (ill-trained) woman of family; better a residence in a forest than in the city of a thoughtless king; better is the abandonment of life than approaching the base (with a request). 
; 022.07
Moreover. As service destroys all self-respect, moonlight darkness, old age beauty, the stories about Hari and Hara sin, so does begging destroy even a hundred good qualities.
;hitoeng027.txt
; 022.09
Having reflected thus (said I to myself)-What then? Shall I support myself with another's cake? O hard lot! That too, would be a second door of death.
; 022.11
Superficial learning, sexual enjoyment obtained by payment, and dependence on others for one's bread-these three are humiliations to men. 
; 022.13
A sick man, one in long exile, one eating another's food, and one sleeping (living) in the house of another:  the life which such a man lives is as good as death, while death is rest to him.
; 022.15
Although I considered thus, yet, from avarice, I made up my mind to hoard wealth. For it is said,
; 022.16
Judgment is led astray (warped) by avarice; avarice begets desire; and a man troubled by desire meets with misery both here and hereafter.
; 022.18
Then as I moved about gently I was struck with an old bamboo-stick by that Vinakarna, whereupon I reflected--A covetous man who is (ever) discontented is certainly a traitor to himself. For,
; 022.20
All riches are his whose mind is contented: is not the earth overspread with leather (at it were) to him whose feet are covered with shoes? 
; 022.22
Again. How can that happiness, which is enjoyed by the tranquil-minded, who are satisfied with the nectar of contentment, be theirs, who, attracted by the (lust of) wealth, run here and there? 
; 022.24
Moreover. All has been studied, heard and put into practice by him, by whom, having cast behind all desires, contentment (lit. freedom from desire) has been resorted to. 
; 022.26
Again. Blessed is the life of some one (rarely to be found) in which the door of the rich has not been attended, in which the pain of separation has not been experienced and in which piteous words have not been uttered. 
; 022.28
For. Even a hundred Yojanas (800 miles) are no distances to him who is troubled (spurred on) by thirst; while he, who is content, has no regard even for a thing that is actually in his hand.
; 022.30
It will be advisable, therefore, to decide what to do under the present circumstances.
;hitoeng028.txt
What is a man's (true) duty in this world? Compassion to creatures. What is (real) happiness? Health (lit. freedom from disease). What is affection? Good feeling. And what is wisdom? Decision. 
[Page 23]
; 023.01 
Similarly. When misfortunes assail (a man), wisdom lies in (quickly) coming to a decision; misfortunes at every step overtake those who cannot arrive at a decision. 
; 23.03
Moreover. One should abandon one person to save a family, a family to save a village, and a village to save a country; but for the sake of one's own self, one should abandon the whole world, 
; 23.05
Again. Of the two -- water obtained with ease (lit. without trouble) and delicious food attended with fear, on consideration, I find, indeed, that to be conducive to happiness, wherein lies ease.
; 23.07
Having thus reflected I came to a dreary forest. For,
; 23.08
Better is a forest, haunted by tigers and lordly elephants, wherein the trees serve as a home, ripe fruits and water as food, grass as a bed and barks as garments, than a life without wealth among relatives.
; 023.12
Then by the manifestation of the fruit of my religious merit, I was favoured with friendly intercourse by this friend. And now, by a further continuation of merit, I have got your company, which is heaven itself. 
; 023.14
For. Of the poisonous tree of worldly existence, two fruits only have a flavoury juice (are sweet); viz. the tasting of the nectar of poetry and the society of the good.
Manthara said--
; 023.17
Riches are comparable to (as unsteady as) the dust of the feet; youth flies away with the rapidity of a mountain river; life is as fleeting as a rolling drop of water, and existence as evanascent as foam; (such being the case) he, who, with his judgment deprived, does not perform his religious duties, which unfasten the bolt of the gate of heaven, being overtaken by old age and full of contrition, is burnt by the fire of sorrow.
[Page 24] 
; 024.01
You laid up too large a hoard; and this ill consequence was the result of that. Hear,
; 024.02
; This translation far from text.
To spend in charity is just to save the money that is acquired, as an outlet is, in the case of water stored up in the bowels of a tank, (the only way to preserve it in a good condition). Moreover,
;hitoeng029.txt
; 024.04
Since a miser buries his wealth, deeper and deeper in the earth, he makes a passage for it, beforehand, to go to its nether abode (to disappear in the bowels of the earth). 
; 024.06
Again. He who wishes to acquire wealth denying comfort to himself (at the sacrifice of personal comfort) is simply an abode of trouble like one bearing burdens for others. 
; 024.08
And again. If people are to be considered rich for possessing wealth which is not used in charity or enjoyment, why should we not consider ourselves rich by the same? 
; 024.10
Also. A miser's wealth, inasmuch as it is not used, is the common property of others; the fact that it belonged to him is known by the sorrow caused when it is lost.
; 024.12
A gift accompanied with sweet words, knowledge without vanity, courage attended by forbearance, and wealth spent in charity: these four are rare in this world. 
; 024.14
It is also said. A hoard should always be made, but not too great a one; Lo ! The jackal that was in the habit of hoarding was killed by a bow.
The two asked how that was. Manthara related--
; 
FABLE VI.
; 024.18
There was a hunter, Bhairava by name, residing in the province of Kalyana. He, one day, went to the Vindhya forest in search of a deer. As he passed carrying the deer that he had killed, he saw a boar of a formidable form. Then the hunter placed the deer on the ground and wounded the boar with an arrow. The boar too, having set up a deep and dreadful cry (or, a cry as terrible as the thunder of clouds ) struck the hunter in the groin, upon which he fell down like a tree struck down. For,
; 024.23
Having met with some cause, such as water, fire, poison, a weapon, hunger (starvation), a disease, or a fall from a mountain, a creature loses his life.
; 024.25
Now by the tramplings of their feet a serpent too was killed. After this a jackal, Dirgharava, by name, who was wandering in quest of prey, found the deer, the hunter, the serpent and the boar, dead there; upon which he said to himself--Oh, here have I come across a good feast. Or rather,
; 024.28
Just as unthought-of misfortunes befall men, so do blessings also: I think, therefore, that fate has an upper hand in these things.
;hitoeng030.txt
[Page 25] 
; 025.01 
Well then. I shall live happily for three months on the flesh of these.
; 025.02
The man will last for a month, and the deer and the boar for two more: the serpent will serve me (as food for) a day while the bow-string should be eaten to-day.
; 025.04
Let me, therefore, at the first impulse of hunger, eat the unsavoury string made of sinews attached to the bow. When Dirgharava had done so after having thus reflected, he being pierced in the breast by the bow which flew up as soon as the string was cut into two, perished. Hence I say -- A hoard should be made every day &c. So also,
; 025.07
That which a wealthy man gives away or enjoys is his wealth; when he dies, others play with his wife and riches. 
; 
Moreover. I consider that to be thy wealth which thou givest to the worthy and which thou enjoyest (day by day), the rest thou keepest for some one else.
; 025.11
Let this pass. What is the use, now, of describing the past? For,
; 025.12
Men of wise minds do not wish for what is unattainable, do not lament over what is lost, and do not lose courage even in adversities.
; 025.14
Therefore, friend, you should always be hopeful. Because,
; 025.15
Even after having studied the sastras people may remain fools; that man is learned who puts his knowledge into practice: a medicine, although well selected, does not restore the diseased to health by the mere mention of its name. 
; 025.17
Moreover. The knowledge of theory does not do the least good to one who shrinks from a determined exertion (or perseveranoe): does a lamp, in this world, reveal a thing to a blind man although it be placed on the palm of his hand ?
; 025.19
Therefore, friend, you ought to be reconciled to this particular (changed) condition. And you should not consider this as very hard to do. For,
; 025.20
A king, a woman of family, Brahmanas, ministers, breasts, teeth, hair, nails and men do not shine (appear well) when fallen from their proper position. 
; 025.22
Knowing this a wise man should not leave his own place.
; 025.23
These are the words of cowardly persons. For,
;hitoeng031.txt
; 025.24
Lions, good men and elephants leave their places and go to others; while crows, cowardly men and deer perish in their own places.
; 025.26
To a high-minded hero, what is his own and what is a foreign country? Whatever country he resorts to, the same he acquires by the might of his arms : whichever forest the lion, armed with his jaws, claws and tail, enters, in the same he quenches his thirst with the blood of the lordly elephants he kills. 
[Page 26] 
; 26.01
Again. As frogs repair to a puddle or birds to a lake full (of water), so do all fortunes to an industrious man helplessly (being entirely at his disposal). 
; 26.03
Moreover. Happiness should be welcomed, and also misery, as they fall to one's share: Happiness and misery revolve (follow each other) like a wheel. 
; 26.05
Again. The goddess of wealth goes, of her own Accord, for residence, to him who is endowed with energy, who is prompt in action, who knows the theory and practice of a thing, who is not addicted to vices, and who is brave, grateful and firm in friendship. 
; 26.07
And particularly. A heroic person, although without wealth, attains a high position attended with great honour; while a miser, though endowed with riches, becomes an object of contempt. Can a dog, although wearing necklaces of gold, possess the majesty of the lion, which is a natural possession and which is the province for the attainment of a number of good qualities?
; 026.11
Why should you be proud when you have wealth, and why should you be sorry when you have lost it? The ups and downs (in the life) of man are like (risings and fallings of) a ball struck with the hand. 
; 026.13
Again. The shadow of clouds, the friendship of a wicked man, new corn, women, youth and wealth are to be enjoyed but for a short while.
; 026.15
One should not work too hard for livelihood : for that is provided by the creator: so soon as a creature is born, the breasts of the mother overflow with milk. 
; 026.17
Moreover, friend. He who made the swans white, the parrots green, and the peacocks of a varied colour, will provide for your sustenance.
; 026.19
Hear, also, friend, the secret of the good.
; 026.20
;hitoeng032.txt
How can riches be conducive to happiness, since they cause trouble in their acquisition, give pain in adversity (by their want) and stupefy the mind in prosperity? 
; 026.22
Again. Better is the absence of desire for him who wishes to acquire money for religious purposes : for rather than wash off mud it would be well to keep at a distance from it and so not to touch it.
; 026.24
For. As meat (food) is eaten by birds in the sky, by beasts on earth, and by crocodiles in water, so is a rich man (his wealth) fed upon everywhere.
; 026.26
There is ever fear to the wealthy from the king, from water, from fire, from a thief, and even from a relative, as there is from death to the living. 
[Page 27]
; 027.01
Similarly. In life which abounds in troubles what misery can be greater than this, that wealth is not obtained according to desire and yet desire does not turn back? 
; 027.03
Hear me again, brother.
; 027.04
In the first place wealth is not easily obtained, and when obtained it can be preserved with difficulty; its loss is as if death: one should not therefore think of it.
; 027.06
When desire is abandoned, who is poor and who is rich? But if scope is allowed to it, servitude is the immediate result (inevitable lot). 
; 027.08
Moreover. Whatever one may wish for, desire proceeds onward from that (ever increases); but that thing may be said to be really obtained from which desire turns back.
; 027.10
But why waste more words on the subject? Being in friendship with me, pass your time just here in my company. For,
; 027.11
The friendship of the noble-minded lasts till death; their anger vanishes the very moment (it appears) and their favours (lit. gifts ) are disinterested.
; 027.13
Having listened to all this, Laghupatanaka said -- Blessed are you, Manthara; your virtues are laudable in every way. Because,
; 027.14
The good alone are able to rescue the good from misery; elephants alone are able to deliver elephants sunk into mire. 
; 027.16
He alone on earth, of all men, is worthy of praise, he is the best, he is a good man and he is blessed, from whom supplicants {;hitoeng033.txt} or persons seeking protection go not away with faces turned back through disappointment (lit. frustration of hopes).
; 027.18
Thus did they (the three friends) live in happy contentment, feasting and sporting at will.
; 027.19
Now on one occasion, a deer, Chitranga by name, frightened by some one, came and joined them. Thereupon, apprehending that the person who had caused the fright might be coming after the deer, Manthara entered the water, the mouse a hole and the crow flew up and perched on the top of a tree. Then Laghupatanaka, looking to a great distance, found that no one that would cause fright was coming. Then in pursuance of his words all of them again joined company and sat just there. Manthara said -- Good, O deer, you are welcome. You are at liberty to enjoy provisions such as water and the like. Do you favour the forest with your residence here (lit., let the forest have a master by your residence here). Chitranga said, I who was alarmed by the hunters have come to you for protection and desire your friendship. Hiranyaka replied -- As for friendship, you have secured that without an effort. For,
; 027.27
A friend is known to be of four kinds, viz. -- by whole blood, by family connexion, an hereditary friend and one delivered from misfortunes.
; 027.29
Your Honour, therefore, should live here as if in your own house (Make yourself quite at home here ). Upon hearing this, the deer was delighted and having eaten at pleasure and drunk water sat in the shade of a tree that grew near the water. Now Manthara asked -- Friend deer, by whom were you frightened in this desolate wood? What, are there huntsmen roaming about? The deer replied.
; 28.01
In the country of Kalinga there is a king, Rukmangada by name. In the courses of his conquest of the quarters he has come here and stays on the bank of the Chandrabhaga with his army encamped there. And a rumour is heard from the mouth of sportsmen that to-morrow he is sure to come and take his residence near the Karpura lake. So having regard to the fact that our residence here to-morrow is beset with danger, do what the time demands. Hearing that the tortoise said in terror-I will make for another pool. The crow and the deer, too, said -- Let it be so. Then Hiranyaka said smilingly -- It will be all well with Manthara when another lake is reached, but what means of protection has he while crawling along the ground ? For,
;hitoeng034.txt
; 028.08
Water is the greatest strength of acquatic animals, a fortress of those who habitually reside in fortresses, their own ground of beasts and other animals, and a minister of kings.
; 028.10
Friend Laghupatanaka, this advice will lead to a result like this.
; 028.11
You will fare like the merchant's son who became unhappy on beholding with his own eyes his wife's breasts hard pressed.
They asked-How was this ? Hiranyaka related.
FABLE VII.
; 028.15
There was, in the country of Kanyakubja, a king whose name was Virasena. He appointed a prince, named Tungabala, governor of the city of Virapura. Possessed of great wealth and young, he, while walking about, one day, in his city, saw a young merchant's wife, Lavanyavati by name, who was in the very prime of youth. On returning to his palace with a heart disturbed by love, he sent a messenger for her. For,
; 028.19
So long only does a man keep to the path of virtue, has control over his senses, feels shame and clings to modesty, as the arrows in the shape of glances cast by sportive ladies, discharged after being drawn from the bows of their eyebrows, which reach the region of the ear, which have the dark eyelashes (for feathers) and which rob one of courage, do not fall on his breast.
; 028.23
That Lavanyavati too, from the moment she saw him, thought solely of him, her heart being deeply wounded by the fallings of the shafts of love. For, it is said
; 028.25
Infidelity, a spirit of adventure, deceit, jealousy, extreme avarice, absence of good qualities and want of purity -- these are the natural defects of women.
[Page 29]
Now on hearing the words of the go-between Lavanyavati said -- I am devoted to my husband. How shall I then think of doing this irreligious deed of being faithless to my husband? For,
; 029.03
She is a wife who is diligent in the management of the household ; she is a wife who is prolific in children; she is a wife who loves her husband as her own life, and she is a wife who is solely devoted to her husband.
; 029.05
She should not be called a wife in whom the husband does not delight: when the husband is pleased, all the deities are pleased with women.
;hitoeng035.txt
; 029.07
Therefore, whatever the lord of my life orders me to do, I do without questioning (its propriety). The messenger asked -- Is this the truth? Lavanyavati replied -- Beyond doubt this is the truth. Then the messenger went back and reported all that to Tungabala. Having heard it Tungabala observed -- How can this be possible that the husband would bring her here and offer her to me? The go-between said -- Let a device be used. For it is said --
; 029.11
That which can be achieved by means of a device cannot be accomplished by valour: An elephant was killed by a jackal going over a miry way. 
; 029.13
The prince asked how it was. She related --
FABLE VIII.
; 029.15
There was an elephant, named Karpuratilaka in Brahmaranya. On seeing him all the jackals thought to themselves--if by some means this can die, his body will afford us sufficient food for four months. Then an old jackal from among them declared I will bring about his death by the power of my intellect. Then the wily fellow having gone to Karpuratilaka and bowed to him touching the ground with the eight parts of his body said -- My lord, favour me with a glance. The elephant asked -- Who art thou? Whence art thou come? He replied -- I am a jackal and sent to Your Honour's presence by all the inhabitants of the forest having assembled together (to say):-- Since it is not expendient to live without a king Your Honour has been selected, as possessed of all kingly qualities, to be installed king of the forest. For,
; 029.26
He, who is extremely pure as regards his family, nobility and conduct, is chivalrous, pious, and versed in politics, is worthy of being a king on earth. 
; 029.28
Moreover. One should first obtain a king, then a wife and then wealth: in the absence of a king, whence can there be wife or wealth? 
; 029.30
Again. Like rain, the lord of the earth is the support of creatures : life can be sustained, however, even when there is scarcity of rain, but not in the absence of a king. 
; 029.32
Moreover. In this interdependent world a man keeps within the bounds of duty mostly through the dread of punishment; a man of good conduct is difficult to be found;
; 030.01
And it is through the fear of punishment also, that a woman of good family {;hitoeng036.txt}approaches (keeps faithful to) her husband, though lean, deformed, sickly and penniless.
; 030.03 
Your Majesty, therefore, should be so pleased as to come quickly that the auspicious moment may not be lost. Having said so he rose up and went away. Thereupon that Karpuratilaka, drawn by the lust of a kingdom and running by the way taken by the jackal, got stuck in deep mud. Then the elephant said -- Friend, jackal, what should be done now? I am plunged in mud and shall perish. Just turn back and look at me. The jackal replied with a smile, My lord, take hold of my tail and get up. Since you placed confidence in the words of one like me, suffer the misery for which there is no help. For, it is said
; 030.11
When thou wilt take delight in the company of the good thou shalt prosper : but as soon as thou joinest the company of wicked men, thou shalt fall (suffer ruin).
; 030.13
Then the elephant that had sunk in the deep mire was devoured by the jackals. Therefore I say. “What can be achieved by means of a device" &c. 
; 030.15
Then by the advice of the procuress the prince engaged the young merchant, named Charudatta, as servant. Afterwards he was employed by him in the most confidential affairs.
; 030.17
One day the prince, having bathed and anointed himself and put on gold and jewel ornaments said –- From to-day I have to observe a vow in honour of Gauri which will last for a month. Bring me, therefore, every night, a young woman of a noble family. I shall have to worship her in due form. Thereupon that Charudatta brought and presented a youthfal damsel as described and remaining concealed watched how he acted. That Tungabala too, without touching the young lady, offered her worship from a distance with garments, ornaments and fragrant unguents and sent her away with a guard. Now the young merchant, full of confidence at what he had seen, and his mind biased by avarice, brought his own wife Lavanyavati, and presented her. That Tungabala too, knowing that she was Lavanyavati, the darling of his heart, rose up in a hurry, embraced her firmly and with his eyes closed (in joy ) sported with her on a sofa. Beholding that, the young merchant utterly at a loss to know what to do, like a figure drawn in a painting, was plunged in great sorrow. Hence I say--“On seeing with his own eyes" &c. You too will fare like that.
;hitoeng037.txt
; 030.27
Disregarding those words of friendly counsel, and distraught with great fear, Manthara left the pool and set out for another. They too, Hiranyaka and others, apprehensive of mishap through affection, followed him. Then as he was crawling along the ground, Manthara was seen by a certain huntsman roaming about in the forest. On seeing him he picked him up, and fastened him to his bow, and troubled by thirst and hunger brought on by the fatigue of his wandering about, set out homeward. The deer, the crow and the mouse, plunged in extreme sorrow, followed him. Then Hiranyaka lamented--
; 030.35 
Scarcely have I gone to the end of one misfortune, as of the ocean, when another has befallen me: when there are weak points misfortunes multiply (misfortunes come not singly). 
[Page 31]
; 031.01
That natural friend who is obtained simply by good luck and whose affection is sincere (lit. not artificial) does not forsake as even in adversity.
; 031.03
Men have not that confidence in a mother, wife, brother or son, which they have in a friend by natural disposition.
; 031.05
Thinking (over the matter) thus again and again. -- 0 misfortune! For,
; 031.06
In this very life have I experienced those changes of condition, like so many births and rebirths, which are the results of a series of my own actions and which are good or bad and happening at stated periods of time.
; 031.08
Or rather it must be just so. The body is subject to perils (lit. has perils near at hand), riches are the abode of misfortunes; and union is attended with disunion: transient is everything created.
; 031.10
On a second reflection he said -- By whom was created this jewel, viz. 'mitra', consisting of two syllables, which protects from the fear arising from the enemy of sorrow (or from sorrow and an enemy), and which is the abode of delight and confidence ? 
; 031.12
Moreover. A friend, who is the elixir of joy to the eyes, the delight of the heart and the sharer of pleasure or pain with his friend, is hard to be found; but those other friends, who, attracted by the lust of riches, gather together in prosperity, are found everywhere: adversity is the touch-stone on which to test their sincerity (real nature).
;hitoeng038.txt
; 031.16
Having thus lamented much, Hiranyaka said to Chitranga and Laghupatanaka -- Before this hunter departs from the forest let an effort be made to deliver Manthara. Tell us, said they, what we are to do. Hiranyaka said -- Let Chitranga go to the water-side and feign himself to be dead. Let the crow sit upon him and peck at him with his bill in some way. Surely the sportsman, eager for the deer's flesh, will quickly make for him, leaving the tortoise there. Then I will gnaw asunder Manthara's bonds. 
[Page 32]
; 032.01
When the sportsman approaches you, you should run away. When Chitranga and Laghupatanaka had quickly acted as they had been instructed, the huntsman, who being fatigued had drunk water and sat under a tree, noticed the deer in that condition. Then delighted at heart, he took up his scissors and went towards him. In the meanwhile, Hiranyaka came and cut off Manthara's bonds, and the tortoise quickly entered the pond. The deer seeing the huntsman approach him started up and bounded away. When the hunter, having returned, came to the foot of the tree and saw not the tortoise there, he thus reflected -- This is but meet in the case of me who have acted rashly. For,
; 032.10 
He who leaves certainties and pursues uncertainties, loses what is certain, while what is uncertain is already (or, certain to be) lost (to him).
; 032.12
So he returned to his place disappointed through his own (rash) act (fault). Manthara and others, being free from calamity, went to their abode and lived in happiness.
; 032.14
Now the princes said joyfully -- We have heard all and become happy. Our desire has been gained. Vishnusarma replied -- So far your desired object has been accomplished. Let there be this much more, too --
; 032.18
May you, o good men, obtain a friend: may the countryfolk gain wealth; may kings govern the earth, ever abiding by their duty; may the policy of good statesmen, like a wife newly wedded, be for the delight of your heart; and may the divine one who has the crescent moon for his crest-jewel do good to the people!!
;
Chapter II.  THE SEPARATION OF FRIENDS.
; 032.23
The princes said -- Sir, as for 'The Acquisition of Friends' we have heard that. Now we wish to learn the chapter on {;hitoeng039.txt} 'The Separation of Friends'. Vishnusarma said -- Hear then "The Separation of Friends', of which this is the introductory sloka: --
; 032.27
A great friendship, that was growing between a lion and a bull in a forest, was destroyed by a wily and very ambitious jackal.
; 032.29
The princes asked--How was this? Vishnusarma related–-
; 032.31
There is in the southern country a city Suvarnavati by name. In it dwelt a merchant named Vardhamana. Although in the possession of a large fortune, yet, seeing that his relatives were very opulent, he thought of again adding to his wealth. For,
; 032.34
The greatness of what man that looks lower and lower (i. e. looks upon himself as a very small man or looks at those who are in a humbler station) does not increase? But every one who looks higher and higher (i. e. considers himself as very great, or turns his eyes upon those who are in a higher station) becomes poor. 
[Page 33]
; 033.01
Moreover. A man who has abundant wealth, although he be a Brahmana-killer, is respected; while one, although claiming a pedigree as noble as that of the moon, is despised, if without wealth. 
; 033.03
Again. The goddess of wealth does not wish to embrace (favour) him who is not industrious, who is lazy, who trusts in fate and who is not enterprising, as a young woman does not an old husband. 
; 033.05
Also. Idleness, attendance on women, a diseased state, a fond partiality for one's native place, contentment, and cowardliness are the six impediments to greatness. 
; 033.07
For. When a man considers himself as happily situated, even with little wealth, Fate, I think, having done its duty, does not increase that wealth of his. 
; 033.09
Moreover. May not a woman bring forth such a son as is without energy, joy, and valour, and is a source of delight to his enemies. 
; 033.11
It is also said. One should desire to obtain that which is unobtained, keep safe with judicious care what is obtained, properly increase what is preserved, and bestow the same on worthy recipients when it has been increased.
;hitoeng040.txt
; 033.13
For, if a man does not desire what he does not possess, he makes no exertion for it and remains inactive and does not get it. What is gained, if not properly taken care of, will waste away of itself, although amounting to a nidhi (a vast treasure). Again, wealth, which is not increased, will be reduced to nothing in course of time, although used sparingly like collyrium; and if it be not enjoyed, it is simply useless. As it is said--
; 033.17
What is the use of wealth when one neither gives it away nor enjoys it? What is the use of strength when one can do no harm to one's foes? What is the use of the knowledge of scriptures when one does not perform the holy rites? And what is the use of soul when one cannot curb the senses?
[Page 34]
; 034.01
Again. Having marked the (gradual) decrease of collyrium and the growth of ant-hill, one should turn a day to account (lit. make it fruitful) by spending it in charity, study and (other) acts. 
; 034.03
For. A jar is gradually filled up by the falling of water into it drop by drop: the same principle applies to the acquisition of all knowledge, religious merit and wealth.
; 034.05
He, who passes his days without charity and enjoyment, does not live although breathing, like the bellow of a blacksmith.
; 034.07
Having thus reflected he yoked two bulls, Nandaka and Samjivaka to his cart, filled it with wares of different kinds, and started for Kashmir for the purpose of trade. For,
; 034.09
What is too great a burden to the strong? What is distant to the industrious? What is a foreign land to the learned? And who is stranger to those who talk sweetly?
; 034.11
Now as they were going on, Samjivaka got his knee broken and fell down in the great forest called Sudurga. Seeing him Vardhamana thus meditated--
; 034.13
Let a man versed in policy make an exertion one way or another, the fruit then (that he reaps) is that which providence has willed for him.
; 034.15
Indecision, which is an obstruction to all actions, should, by all means, be abandoned; having, therefore, given up indecision, success should be attained in the object desired.
; 034.17
Having thus reflected and left Samjivaka there, Vardhamana himself went back to a town named Dharmapura, brought {;hitoeng041.txt} another stout bull, fastened him to the yoke of the cart and journeyed on. Thereafter Samjivaka too, having supported his weight on three legs, rose up. For,
; 034.21
Life (when one is to live longer) preserves safe the vitals of one although plunged into the ocean or fallen from a mountain or bitten by the deadliest of cobras.
; 034.23
Although pierced with hundreds of arrows, a creature will not die out of his time (of death); but when his time has arrived he will not live when pierced even with a blade of the Kusa grass.
; 034.25
That which is defended by Fate lives, although (otherwise) unprotected, and that which is smitten by fate perishes, although well guarded: one without a protector and left in a desert lives (when protected by fate), while one (doomed to die) does not live in a house, although well taken care of (lit. although efforts be made to save him).
; 034.29
Then, as days passed on, Samjivaka, as he feasted and sported at pleasure and roamed through the wood, became sleek and hale in body and bellowed aloud. A lion, Pingalaka by name, lived in that forest, enjoying the pleasures of royalty he had acquired by the might of his arms. For it is said--
; 034.33
No coronation ceremony nor any other rite is performed upon the lion by the beasts: but the sovereignty over beasts of him who acquires a kingdom by his prowess is self-existent. 
; 035.01
Once the lion being troubled by thirst went down to the bank of the Yamuna to drink water. There he heard the bellowing of Samjivaka like the unseasonable roaring of clouds and such as he had never heard before. Hearing that he turned back with a start without drinking water, and, having returned to his abode, stood silent, pondering what it could mean. He was observed in that condition by two jackals, named Karataka and Damanaka, the sons of his minister. Seeing him in that situation, Damanaka said to Karataka -- Dear Karataka, why is it that our lord, although thirsty, has not drunk water but stands still, dazed and alarmed? Karataka replied -- Friend Damanaka, he is not served at all according to our counsel (or, according to my advice he should not be served at all). If that is the case, what is the good of our observing his doings? {;hitoeng042.txt} For, we, who have been long despised by this king without any fault of ours, have suffered great anguish.
; 035.13
See what servants who wish to acquire wealth by means of service have done :— those fools have allowed even the independence of their body to be lost! 
; 035.15
Moreover. A wise man will practise penance and be happy with even a portion of those sufferings caused by cold, wind and heat which those who are dependent on others undergo. 
; 035.17
Again. The fruitfulness of life lies in this much, that one lives a life of independence: if those who are in a state of dependence (be said to) live, then, who are the dead ?
; 035.19
Come, go away, fall down, rise, speak, observe silence -- thus do the wealthy sport with those who are in the grip of the evil spirit of desire.
; 035.21
Fools, like harlots, for the sake of self, deck their persons again and again and make them subservient to others. 
; 035.23
Again. Servants esteem highly even that glance of their master which is naturally unsteady and falls even on an impious person. 
; 035.23
Another consideration is this. If he (a servant) is silent, he is considered to be) stupid; if clever in talking, crazy-headed or garrulous; if forbearing, timid, if he does not bear tamely, mostly he is (set down as) not well-born; if he stands by the side (of his master), he is audacious; but if he stands at a distance, he is not bold: the duties of servitude are extremely abstruse - not to be known even by sages having mystic powers. 
[Page 36]
036.03
He bends down that he should rise, sacrifices life that he should live, and exposes himself to misery that he should be happy--who else is a fool than a servant?
; 036.05
Damanaka said--Friend, you should not entertain such a thought even in the mind. For,
; 036.06
How are great kings not to be served with effort (diligence), who, when pleased, grant desires in a short time? (i.e. they must be served by all means).
; 036.08
 Consider this much more -- Whence can those, who are out of service, have riches with chamaras waved over them, a white umbrella with a prominent staff and a train of servants with horses and elephants?
; 036.10
Karataka replied -- Still what have we to do with this affair? For, one should by all means avoid meddling with affairs with which one has nothing to do. See,
;hitoeng043.txt
036.12
He, who wishes to meddle with matters which are not business of his, lies dead on the ground like the monkey that pulled out the wedge. 
; 036.14
Damanaka asked-How was this? Karataka said--
FABLE I.
; 036.16
In a place near the holy forest in the country of Magadha, a certain man of the writer class, Subhadatta by name, was having a convent built. A carpenter had put a wedge between the two split-up parts of a beam which was being cut with a saw and which was cleft to some length. A troop of apes came there prancing about. One of the apes, as if urged by Death, caught hold of the wedge with his hands and sat there, while his lower parts hanging down entered the split between the two pieces of the wood. Then through the mischievous spirit natural to his species, he drew out the wedge with great effort. As soon as the wedge was pulled out, those parts were squeezed and he perished. Hence I say –- He who wishes to meddle with matters &c. Damanaka said - Still a servant ought to watch the actions of his master. Karataka replied -- Let the prime minister who has charge of all affairs do it. For, a servant must, under no circumstances, interfere with (lit, sit in discussion over) another's business. See,
; 036.32
He, who interferes with another's business with a view to serve his master's good, comes to grief like the ass that was beaten for braying.
; 036.34
Damanaka inquired how it was and Karataka thus went on--
[Page 37]
FABLE II.
; 037.02
In Varanasi dwelt a washerman, named Karpura-pataka. One day, he, having sported for a long time with his young wife, slept soundly. Thereafter a robber got in with the object of stealing the things in the house. In his court-yard there were a donkey tied down and a dog sitting. Now the ass said to the dog-Friend, this is properly your office. Why don't you then rouse the master by barking aloud? The dog replied -- Friend, you should not meddle with my business. Don't you yourself know that I guard his house day and night? Since he has been happy for a long time he does not know of what use I am to him and takes but scanty care to feed me. For, unless some danger is in sight masters care but little for their servants.  The donkey replied -- Hear me, barbarian.
;hitoeng044.txt
; 037.14
He is bad servant and a bad friend (or, is he a servant? is he a friend?) who asks for reward at the time of action (in the hour of need). The dog replied--He is a bad master (or, is he a master?) who speaks sweetly to his servants at the time of need. 
; 037.17
For. In supporting dependents, in serving a master, in the discharge of religious duties and in begetting a son, substitutes will not do.
; 037.19
The donkey said in a rage -- O thou evil-minded one, thou art a villain, since thou neglects thy master's business at a critical time. Well, let it be. But I must do that by which my master will wake up. For,
; 037.22
One should enjoy the heat of the sun from (by exposing) the back-side, fire by the stomach, a master with all one's heart and soul, and the next world with absence of deceit (a pure heart).
; 037.24
With these words, he brayed aloud. Then the washerman, roused by that braying, and angry that his slumbers should have been disturbed, got up and belaboured the donkey with a stick.
; 037.27
Hence I say -- He who interferes with another's business &c. See -- Our office is just to look for game. Let us attend to that. (After reflecting). --  But we are not concerned with that to-day. For there is plenty of food yet left after what was eaten by us. Damanaka observed angrily -- How is it that you serve the king merely for the sake of food? This is unworthy of you. For,
; 037.33
The service of kings is desired by the wise that they should be able to do good to their friends and evil to their enemies; (or else) who does not merely fill the belly?
; 037.35
Fruitful is the life of him, who living, Brahmaņas, friends, and relations live; for, who does not live for his own self? 
; 037.37
Moreover. He really lives, who living, many live: does not a crow fill his belly with his bill? 
[Page 38]
; 038.01
Lo! Some man becomes a servant for five puranas (a kind of inferior coin), another is satisfied with lacs, while another is not to be had even for lacs. 
; 038.03 
Again. When mankind is all equal, a state of servitude is much to be despised: but is he to be counted among the living who is not first even in that (service)? 
;hitoeng045.txt
; 038.05
And in connexion with this, it is said-- Great is the difference between horses, elephants and metals; between kinds of wood, stones, and garments; and between women, men and water (i.e. between horse and horse &c.) 
; 
So also. A dog, having obtained a piece of even a fleshless bone soiled with the remnant of a few sinews and marrow, is quite delighted: it does not, however, satisfy his hunger; while the lion, having discarded a jackal though come to his lap, kills an elephant: every man, although reduced to straits, desires a reward befitting his valour (or worth).
; 038.11
Moreover, mark the difference between one deserving to be served and (one fit to be) a servant.
; 038.12
Wagging the tail, falling down at the feet and lying on the ground exhibiting the mouth and the belly -- all this the dog does before his master; but the lordly elephant looks on patiently and eats with hundreds of coaxing words (addressed to him).
; 038.16
Again. Those who know it (i. e. what life is) call that, indeed, life which is gloriously lived by men although for a moment, and which is invariably attended with knowledge, exploit and fame: (otherwise) a crow also lives for a long time and eats an oblation.
[Page 39]
; 039.01
Again. What is the use of the life of him in the world of men who does not show pity to his son or to his preceptor, to his servants or to a poor man or to his relations? A crow also lives long and eats oblations.
; 039.05
Also this-- What difference is there between a beast and a human beast whose intellect is void of the power of discriminating between good and bad, who sets at naught most of the rules of conduct enjoined by the sruti and whose only desire is to fill up his belly?
; 039.09
Karataka said--As for us, we are subordinates. This being the case, why should we busy ourselves with this matter? Damanaka replied--In what space of time (i.e. in a short time if they have the ability) do ministers become principal or subordinate ? For,
; 039.13
No one in this world is generous towards, beloved by or wicked to another: it is a man's own actions alone that lead him to greatness or to the reverse (i.e. man is the architect of his own fortune). 
;hitoeng046.txt
; 039.17
Also. Just as a stone is raised to the top of a hill with great efforts but hurled down in a moment, so is the soul led to virtue or vice.
; 039.19
It is by his actions that a man sinks lower and lower, or rises up like the digger of a well or the builder of a wall.
; 039.21
Therefore, friend, a man's position (lit. soul) depends on his exertions. Karataka said -- Now what do you say? He replied -- This our lord Pingalaka has come back frightened at something or other and has sat down. Karataka asked -- Do you know the real fact? Damanaka replied -- What is there that is not known? It is said --
; 039.26
When a thing is expressed in words, even a brute can understand it; even horses and elephants bear (loads) when ordered; a clever man comprehends a meaning although not expressed: for, talent has for its fruit the knowledge of the inward thoughts of others.
; 039.28
The inmost thoughts of a man are divined from his features, gestures, movements, actions, speech and the motion of the eyes and the face. 
[Page 40]
; 040.01
Therefore, on this occasion of fear, I will win over this lord by the force of my intellect. For,
; 040.03
He is a wise man who knows how to address a speech suited to an occasion, or to act in a manner befitting one's good intention or to be angry in proportion to one's strength.
; 040.05
Karataka said--Friend, you do not know how to serve. See,
; 040.06
He is a fool who enters (into royal presence) withont being called, speaks much without being asked, and considers himself a favourite of the king.
; 040.08
Damanaka said--Friend, how can I be ignorant of serving?
; 040.09
Is there anything by nature charming or not charming?
Whatever a man likes is charming to him. 
; 040.11
For. Whatever a man's (thought or) feeling be, having ministered to that, a talented man should quickly win him over.
; 040.13
When asked 'who is here' a servant should say 'I; please command'; and he should execute the king's command to the best of his ability. 
; 040.15
Moreover. He, who is modest in his desires, patient, wise, always in attendance like a shadow and would not hesitate when ordered (to do a thing), should dwell in a king's palace.
;hitoeng047.txt
; 040.17
Karataka observed--Perhaps the lord might disregard you for your entrance (into his presence) at an inopportune time. He replied -- Let it be so. Still a servant must necessarily be in the presence of his master. For,
; 040.20
Not beginning a thing through fear of fault (or, of an ill consequence) is the sign of a coward; who, brother, leaves off taking food for fear of indigestion? 
; 040.22
See -- A king favours (or gets attached to) a man who is near him, whether he be illiterate, low-born or unworthy of association (or, not attached to his master): as a general rule, kings, young women and creepers cling to (lit. twine round) him who is near them.
; 040.26
Karataka said -- Now going there what will you say? He said -- Hear me. In the first place I will ascertain whether the master is attached to me or not. Karataka asked -- What is the sign from which this can be known? Damanaka replied -- Listen.
[Page 41]
; 041.01
Looking (at one) from a distance, smiling, great regard for inquries about one's welfare, praising the merits even in one's absence: remembering one among objects which are dear. 
; 041.03
Attachment even when one does not serve, making a donation with sweet words and noting one's merits even when one is at fault -- these are the signs of a lord well-attached.
; 
Again. Delaying, encouraging hopes, but disappointing as to their fulfilment, these a talented man should know to be the signs of a lord ill-disposed.
; 041.07
Laying all this to heart I will speak in such a way as to bring him under my power. For,
; 041.08  
; translation very far from text
Wise men give us a vivid picture of failure to result from impediments foreseen and a bad use of policy and success resulting from a judicious use of the expedients and the proper employment of policy.
; 041.10
Karataka observed -- Still you should not speak until you find a proper opportunity. For,
; 041.11 
Even Brihaspati uttering a speech out of its season will be contemned as one wanting in discrimination and meet with eternal disgrace.
; 041.13
Damanaka said--Friend, be not afraid. I shall not speak unseasonably. For,
;hitoeng048.txt
; 041.15
A servant having his master's welfare at heart should speak out, unasked, when a calamity is impending, when the master is going astray or when the proper time to do a thing is passing away (when an opportunity is allowed to slip away by his master).
; 041.17
And if I were not to give my counsel when there has been an occasion for it, a minister's post would ill become me. For,
; 041.19
A man of merits should keep up and foster that quality by which be earns his livelihood and for which he is praised in this world by the good.
; 041.21
Therefore, friend, give me your permission. I will go. Karataka said -- My blessing to you. May your path be auspicious (i. e. I wish you godspeed). Do as you desire. Damanaka then repaired into Pingalaka's presence like one amazed. Now, being respectfully received into his presence by the king, he prostrated himself before him, touching the ground with the eight parts of the body, and sat down. The king said -- You are seen after a long time. Damanaka replied -- Although Your Majesty has nothing to do with me as a servant, still a follower must necessarily attend upon his master when the time demands it, and hence have I come here. Moreover, 
[Page 42]
; 042.01
Great lords have occasion even for a blade of grass serving as a tooth-pick or as an ear-scratcher: what to say, then, of man who is gifted with speech and hands!
; 042.03
And even if my noble lord might suspect that I have lost my mental power being long despised, that, too, should not be done. For,
; 042.05
If a gem rolls on the feet and a piece of glass is worn on the head -- let that be as it is -- a piece of glass is glass and a gem a gem.
; 042.07
The loss of intellect of a man of fortitude, although oppressed, must not be suspected; the flame of fire though overturned can never proceed downwards.
; 042.09
My lord, a master ought to be discriminating (lit. marking the difference between good and bad men; or, must recognize special merit). For,
; 042.10
When a king treats (lit. acts towards) all without distinction, the energy of those who are capable of exertion is lost. 
;hitoeng049.txt
; 042.12
Moreover. Men are of three sorts, O king, viz., the best, the lowest and the middling : one should appoint them accordingly to three kinds of employment.
; 042.14
Since. Servants and ornaments ought to be set on their proper places : for, a crest-jewel is not worn on the foot or a foot-ornament on the head. 
; 042.16
Moreover. If a gem fit to be set in a gold ornament is set on tin, it does not cry, nor does it* not shine there: the person setting it there, however, is exposed to censure. 
; * If the reading be 'na cApi sa SoBate', then omit 'not'.
; 042.18
Again. A piece of glass is set in a diadem and a jewel placed in a foot-ornament : the blame does not lie with the gem, but it is the want of discretion on the part of the setter. 
; 042.20
See. A king who knows how to discriminate between servants--e.g., this is talented, this is attached to me, this is brave, while there is danger from this--is surrounded to fullness by servants. 
; 042.22
So also. A horse, a weapon, a text of holy law, a lute, speech, a man and a woman, turn out fit or unfit according to the particular man they come in contact with.
; 042.24
What is the use of a servant, who, though devoted, is without ability or of one who is able but doing harm? It does not behove you, o king, to despise me, who am both devoted and able. 
; 042.26
For. By being despised by a king the servants turn out dullheaded; then on account of their predominance no wise man approaches him; when the kingdom is abandoned by wise men, policy does not become efficacious; and policy having failed the whole world falls a helpless victim to misery. 
; 043.03
Moreover. People always honour the man respected by the king, but he who is despised by the king is slighted by all. 
; 043.05
And further. Wise men should accept what is well said even by a child; is not the light of a lamp acceptable when (or where) the sun is not shining ?
; 043.07
Pingalaka said--Dear Damanaka, why do you talk so? You, the son of our prime minister, did not come here for so long a time believing in the words of some rogue. Now freely say your say. Damanaka said -- Lord, I have a question to ask. {;hitoeng050.txt}  Please reply. Why does my lord stand here, as if amazed, without drinking water, although thirsty ? Pingalaka replied -- You have spoken well. But there is no one trustworthy to whom this secret can be confined. You are such a one. Therefore I will communicate it to you. Listen. This forest has now been inhabited by some beast, unheard of before, and must for that reason, be left by us. I am perplexed on this account. Similarly you too have heard that strange loud sound. Great must be the strength of this animal corresponding to his voice. Damanaka replied -- My lord, this is, indeed, a great cause for fear. We too have heard the sound. But he is a bad minister who first counsels the quitting of land and then a fight. At this crisis when it is difficult to know what steps to take, the use of servants alone is to be known. For,
; 043.22
A man knows (tests) on the touch-stone of adversity the strength of his relatives, wife and servants, as also of his intellect and mental calibre. 
; 043.24
The lion said -- Friend, a great terror has overtaken me. Damanaka said again (To himself --) How, else, can you talk to me of leaving the pleasures of a kingdom and going to another place. (Aloud) My lord, as long as I am alive, Your Majesty should have no fear. But Karataka and others should also be encouraged (by marks of royal favour), since it is difficult to have a united body of men at the time of overcoming a calamity.
; 043.30
Then Damanaka and Karataka, on whom every honour was bestowed by the king, set out having promised to ward off the danger. On the way Karatake said to Damanaka -- Friend, without ascertaining whether the cause of fear is possible to be averted or not, why did you accept this great favour having undertaken the removal of the fear? For unless one has done a service one should not accept a reward from anybody, especially from a king. Observe,
; 043.36
On his (king's) favour depends wealth, on his exploit victory and on his anger death: for he represents all splendours (energies). 
; 043.38
So also. A king although a boy, should not be despised because he is a man; for he is a mighty deity existing in a human form. 
[Page 44]
; 044.01
Damanaka smiled and said -- Friend, rest quiet (easy). I have known the cause of fear. That was the bellowing of a ;{hitoeng051.txt} bull. Bulls form even our food, how much so of the lion then? Karataka observed: If so, why was the fear of the lord not removed just there and then? Damanaka replied -- Had I relieved the king's fear just there, do you think that we could have received this great favour? Also,
; 044.08
The master should never be rendered free from need (of their services) by servants: for having made the master free from need, a servant may fare like Dadhikarna. Karataka asked how it was. Damanaka related :
FABLE III.
; 044.13
On the mountain called Arbudasikhara in the northern region lived a lion, Mahavikrama by name. A certain mouse gnawed the tips of his mane as he slept in his mountain-den. Then seeing the points of his mane bitten off he got angry, but not being able to catch the mouse that was in his hole, he meditated --
; 044.17
When an enemy is insignificant and cannot be overcome by valour, a warrior of his rank should be set forth to kill him.
; 044.19
Having thus reflected he went to a village and having brought a cat, named Dadhikarna, with effort, after securing his confidence, placed him in his den, feeding him on flesh. Thereafter the mouse did not come out of his hole through fear of the cat and the lion slept comfortably, his mane not being bitten. Whenever he heard the noise of the mouse he fed the cat with flesh with greater attention. Once the mouse, as he moved out being oppressed with hunger, was caught by the cat and killed. After that the lion did not hear the sound of the mouse at any time and took little care to feed the cat, as he was no longer useful to him. Then that Dadhikarna, wasting away for want of food, died. Hence my observation –- The master should not be made &c.
; 044.28
Then Damanaka and Karataka went to Samjivaka. Of the two Karataka sat under a tree in a dignified manner. Damanaka went forward to Samjivaka and said -- O bull, this general Karataka here, appointed to keep guard over the forest by king Pingalaka, orders you--Come here at once; or, retire to a distance from this wood: else the consequence will be disastrous (adverse) to you. I don't kuow what our royal master, if angry, will do. Then Samjivaka, ignorant of the ways and manners of the country, advanced with fear and made a profound bow to Karataka. For it is said,
{;hitoeng052.txt}
; 044.35
Talent, indeed, is of greater consequence than physical strength, for the lack of which such is the condition of elephants -- this, as it were, the kettle-drum, sounding, proclaims, when beaten by the elephant-driver.
; 044.37
Then Samjivaka asked in fear--General, what am I to do? Tell me that. Karataka said if thou at all wishest to live safe in this wood, go and bow to the lotus-like feet of our lord.
[Page 45]
; 045.01  
Samjivaka replied--Then give me the promise of safety and I will go -- for this purpose let your honour offer me your right hand as a pledge. Karataka replied —- Dismiss this fear, O bull! For, 
; 045.03
Kesava returned not a reply to the king of Chedi who was abusing him: the lion roars in response to the thunder of clouds and not to the howlings of jackals. 
; 045.05
Again. A hurricane does not uproot grass, soft and bending humbly all round; but it works havoc upon the lofty trees -- a great man exerts his might only upon the great.
; 045.08
Now the two, having posted Samjivaka at some distance, repaired into the presence of the lion. Then being received with respectful attention by the king they bowed and sat down. The king asked (Damanaka) -- Did you see the beast ? Damanaka said in reply -- Yes, Your Highness. But what Your Highness conjectured is quite so (correct). He is certainly huge and seeks an interview with Your Highness. But as his strength is great, Your Highness should receive him, after putting yourself in a defensive position. Let not Your Highness be alarmed at the mere sound. For it is said --
; 045.15
One should not be alarmed at a mere sound, without knowing its cause. Having found out the cause of the sound, a procuress attained honour.
; 045.17
The king asked -- how was this? Damanaka related :
FABLE IV.
; 045.20
There is a city, called Brahmapura, on the mountain Sriparvata. A rumour had got current there that its peak was haunted by a giant, called Ghantakarna. One day, a robber who was running away with a bell, was killed by a tiger and devoured. The bell, fallen from his hands, was picked up by monkeys, who used to ring it every moment. Now the inhabitants of the city found the man eaten there. And the sound of the bell too was constantly heard. Thereupon, saying {;hitoeng053.txt} that Ghantakarna being angry devours men and rings the bell, all people fled from the city. Then a certain procuress, Karala by name, thinking--'this sound of the bell is out of time ; can it be that the monkeys ring the bell' -- and having ascertained for herself that it was so requested the king, saying 'Sire, if a certain amount of money be spent, I will manage this Ghantakarna.' Then the king gave her wealth. The procuress drew a magic circle, and after a great display of the worship of Ganesa and others, herself entered the forest taking with her such fruits as the monkeys like and scattered them. Thereupon, the monkeys, having left off the bell busied themselves with the fruit. The procuress, too, having taken the bell, returned to the city and became an object of respect to all. Therefore I say -- One should not be alarmed at the mere sound &c. Then, Samjivaka was brought and presented (to the lion). Afterwards he lived there in great joy. 
[Page 46]
; 046.01  
Now, one day, the lion's brother, Stabdhakarna by name, came there (on a visit). Having received him hospitably and asked him to sit down, Pingalaka set out to hunt a beast to feed him with. Just then Samjivaka asked -- My lord, where is the flesh of the deer killed to-day? The king said -- Damanaka and Karataka know that. Sanjivaka said -- Let it be known whether or not there is any left. The lion after reflecting said -- No, there is nothing left. Samjivaka asked -- How could they eat so much flesh? The king replied -- It was eaten, used someway or wasted. This is the daily course. Samjivaka observed -- How is this done without the knowledge of Your Highness ? The king replied -- It is done quite without my knowledge. Samjivaka remarked -- This is not proper. For it is said --
; 046.13
One should not do any business on one's own responsibility without informing the master of it, except it be to ward off a calamity befalling the king. 
; 046.15
Moreover. A minister is like a gourd that gives out little and takes in much. A man who talks lightly* [* i. e., does not care for them and so wastes them,] of a moment remains a fool, O king, while one who talks lightly of a cowri remains a pauper.
; 046.17
That minister is the best (for a king) who every day adds (at least) a kakini (to the treasury); for the treasury is the (real) life of a king, and not his own life so. {;hitoeng054.txt}
; 046.19
Again, a man does not attain a position of being served by reason of other family-observances (such as polite conduct &c. other than the possession of wealth); a man without wealth is abandoned even by his wife; how much more then by others ?
; 046.21
And this is the cardinal defect in the administration of a state.
; 046.22
Over-expenditure, want of supervision, as also raising money by unfair means, plundering and distant situation -- these are the evils of the treasury. 
; 046.24
For. A man of wealth, who spends his money at his will recklessly without looking to his income, is reduced to poverty although as rich as Kubera.
[Page 47]
; 047.01 
Stabdhakarna observed--Listen, brother. These two, Damanaka and Karataka, your servants of long standing, who are the ministers of war and peace, must not at all be appointed to supervise the treasury. I will also tell you what little I have heard on the subject of making appointments.
; 047.04
A Brahmana, a Kshatriya and a relative should not preferably be appointed as treasury-officers. A Brahmana does not deliver up even under pressure the money though realized.
; 047.06
A Kshatriya having charge of money-matters is sure to show his sword (defy his master); while a relative, on the strength (by virtue) of his kinship, swallows the whole thing, having seized it.
; 047.08
An officer who has been a servant of long standing is fearless even when he has committed a fault; and having despised his master will act freely (lit. without any restraint).
; 047.10
A benefactor (one who has done a service) when appointed to an office is regardless of his own offence and putting forward his obligation will appropriate the whole thing.
; 047.12
Since a play-friend from childhood, if appointed a minister, himself acts as a king, he is sure always to despise (his master) on account of his familiarity.
; 047.14
He who is perverse in the mind but outwardly forbearing, verily brings on ruin of every kind: Sakuni and Sakatara, O king, will serve as instances of this. 
; 047.16
All ministers when grown great are incorrigible in the end. It is a saying of the Siddhas (sages, perfect seers) that abundance perverts the mind.
;hitoeng055.txt
; 047.18
Not accepting the money coming to hand, misappropriation of money, easy compliance, neglect, want of judgment, absence of perception (taking a right view of things), and enjoyment (habit of luxury)--these are the faults in a minister.
; 047.20
Finding out means to seize the money (illegally) obtained by an officer, daily supervision (over the officers' work), bestowing honours (according to merit) and change of duties, -- this is the duty of kings.
[Page 48]
; 048.01
Officers, unless hard pressed, will not disgorge the royal money embezzled by them for they are mostly like malignant ulcers (which also do not give out the putrid matter without being pressed).
; 048.03
A king should fine* [* Or, ought to fine officers who have misappropriated sums of money.] repeatedly (corrupt) officers large sums of money: for does the garment used at the time of bathing yield up (give out) much water when wrung out only once?
; 048.05
One should remember all this and act accordingly, as an emergency may arise. Pingalaka said -- It is just so. But these two never obey my order. Stabdhakarna observed –- This is not at all proper. For,
; 048.09
A king should not forgive those who disobey orders, even though they be his sons: for (in that case) what difference can there be between such a king and one drawn in a picture? 
; 048.11
Moreover. The fame of one who is inactive comes to an end; so does the friendship of one of unsettled conduct; the family of one who has lost the vigour of his senses; the sense of duty of one intent on acquiring wealth; the fruit of the learning of one who is addicted to vices; the happiness of a miser, and the sovereignty of one whose ministers are careless.
; 048.15
More especially. A king should, like a father, protect his subjects from robbers, from his officers, from enemies, from his favourites and from his own avarice.
; 048.17
Brother, let my advice be always acted upon. I too have transacted business. Let this Samjivaka who eats corn be appointed to superintend the treasury. That being done, from that time onward, Pingalaka and Samjivaka passed their time in great friendship, having left {;hitoeng056.txt} off all other connexions. Then Damanaka and Karataka, finding that there was a relaxation in dealing out food even to the servants, consulted mutually. Then Damanaka said to Karataka-Friend, what is to be done? This is our own fault. And it is not proper to lament over an evil of one's own making. For it is said--
; 048.25
I for having touched Svarnarekha, the procuress for having bound herself, the merchant for wishing to steal the gem--all these suffered for their own faults. Karataka asked--How was that? Damanaka went on--
FABLE V
; 048.30
In the city of Kanchanapura lived a king named Viravikrama. As his officer of justice was leading a barber to the place of execution, the latter was held by the skirt of his garment by a certain recluse, Kandarpaketu by name, accompanied by another man, Sadhu (a mendicant), with the words "This barber should not be killed." The king's officers asked why he should not be killed. He said, hear--He repeated--I having touched Svarnarekha &c. They asked--How is this?
[Page 49]
; 049.01
The recluse told as follows--I am the son of Jimutaketu, king of Ceylon, Kandarpaketu by name. One day as I sat in the pleasure-garden I heard from a sea-faring merchant, that, on the fourteenth day of the month, there was to be seen on the sea, under a desire-granting tree that appeared then-seated upon a sofa variegated with a ring of the rays of gems and decorated with ornaments of all kinds --maiden, like the goddess Lakshmi, playing upon a lyre. Then I, in company with the sea-merchant, got on board his ship, and sailed for the place. On going there I saw, as described, on a sofa, the damsel, half submerged. Then charmed with her beauty I gave a jump after her. After that on reaching a golden city, I saw her seated on a couch, in the same manner, in a gold palace, and attended by Vidyadhara women. She too, having seen me from a distance, sent her friend and (through her) addressed me with respect. To my inquiry her friend replied-–This is the daughter of Kandarpaketu, the imperial king of the Vidyadharas, Ratnamanjari by name. She has taken this vow -- "He who having come to Kanakapattana beholds it with his eyes will be my husband even in the absence of my father". Such is her mind's resolve. Your Honour should, therefore, marry her by the {;hitoeng057.txt} Gandharva form of marriage. So the Gandharva marriage being concluded I lived there enjoying the sweets of her company. One day she said to me in private--Lord, you may enjoy everything here according to your wishes; but you should never touch this Vidyadhara female, Svarnarekha by name, painted here. 
; 049.20
Thereafter my curiosity being roused, I touched that Svarnarekha with my hand. Then I was struck by her with her lotus-like foot, though a mere picture, so that I came, and fell in my kingdom. Then being smitten with grief I turned out a recluse and in the course of my wandering came to this city. Here, yesterday, while lying down,'at the house of a cowherd I saw--As the cowherd came home in the evening from the liquor-shop kept by his friend, he saw his wife planning something with a procuress. Then he beat the cowherdess, made her fast to a post and went to bed. Then at midnight the procuress, the wife of this barber, again came to the cowherd's wife and said--That noble person, burnt by the fire of your separation, and pierced with the shafts of the god of love is about to die for you. Pained at heart on finding him in that condition I have come here to persuade you. I will then wait here having tied myself to the post; you should go there and return quickly after having acted to his wishes. After that was done the cowkeeper awoke and said to her--Why dost thou not go to your gallant now? But as she returned no reply, he saying,
How is it that you, in your vanity, do not even give me an answer!, seized a pair of scissors in a rage and cut off her nose. This done, the cowherd again lay down and sank into sleep.
Now the cowherd's wife, returning, asked the barber's wife
[Page 50]
what the news was. The procuress replied--Look here, my
face will tell you the news. Thereafter the cowherdess tied herself to the post and stood as before. The procuress, too, took up her nose and having gone home lay there. Then in the morning when this barber asked her for the razor-case, she gave him one razor only. Thereupon, this barber, going into a passion as the whole case was not handed over to him threw the razor from some distance into the house. Upon this setting up a cry of pain and saying 'Without any provocation he has cut off my nose' she brought him to the officer of justice. In the meanwhile, the cowherd's wife being again asked by the cowherd exclaimed--Who, vile wretch, is able to disfigure me who am so very chaste. The eight guardians of the world alone know how free from sin all my actions are. For,
;hitoeng058.txt

58
The sun and the moon, wind and fire, heaven and earth, water, the heart, Yama, day and night, both the twilights and the deity Dharma-—these know the actions of a man.
If then, I am perfectly chaste, and have never even so much as thought of a man other than yourself, let my face be free from its wound. Look at my face. Then as soon as the cow-keeper lighted a lamp, looked at her face and found that it had the nose restored, he fell at her feet saying--Blessed am I whose wife is thus perfectly virtuous. Now attend to the story of the merchant who is here. He, having left his house, came to this city after twelve years, from the vicinity of mount Malaye. He slept in the house of a courtesan. At the door of the harlot's house there stood the wooden image of a spirit, on whose head there was a jewel of the best sort. Seeing that, this merchant, being impelled by avarice, got up in the middle of the night and attempted to take the jewel. Then being pressed by the arms of the spirit which were moved by wires, he uttered a cry of pain. Thereupon the harlot, having got up; said--Holloa, son, you have come from the neighbourhood of Malaya. Deliver, therefore, all the jewels you have to him, else he will not release you. Such is this wily fellow. Then this merchant gave up all his jewels. And now, he too, being robbed of all his wealth, has joined our party.
On hearing all this the king's officers got the judge to do justice. The barber's wife was shaved, the cowherdess expelled the city, the harlot fined and the merchant restored to all his wealth. The barber too went home. Therefore I say-I for having touched Svarnarekha &c. Now this fault is ours, and lamentation is out of place in this case. Having reflected for a moment--Friend, just as I brought about the friendship of these too, so should I effect the disunion of the two friends also. For,
Very clever men represent even untruth as truth (if required), as persons versed in the art of painting represent depressions and prominences on an even surface. Moreover,
He whose intellect does not fail him even under fresh occurrences, surmounts difficulties just as the cowherd's wife got clear of her two lovers.
Karataka asked how it was. Damanaka related--
;hitoeng059.txt

59
FABLE VI. 
The wife of a certain cowherd who lived in Dvaraka was of a bad character. She had an intrigue with the magistrate of the place, as also with his son. For it is said--
[Page 51]
Fire is not satisfied with fuel, the ocean with rivers, the god of death with all creatures and a beautiful woman with men. Moreover,
Not by gifts, not by honour, not by simplicity, not by attendance, not with a weapon (fear of punishment) and not with scriptural advice, can women be won over:—they are hard to please in every way. For,
Having forsaken a husband who is the abode of merits, endowed with fame, amiable, versed in the erotic art, wealthy and youthful, women quickly resort to another man (although) destitute of character, good qualities and the like. Moreover,
A woman does not derive that pleasure although lying down on a beautiful bed entirely to her satisaction as she does in the company of a gallant although lying down on the ground covered over with the Durva grass and other things of that sort
One day she was sporting with the magistrate's son, when the magistrate too came there to enjoy her company. Seeing him coming, she put his son in a barn and began to amuse herself with him. After that her husband, the cowherd, returned from the cowpen. On spying him the cowherdess said to the magistrate-you take a stick and quickly go out as if in a rage. He having acted ancordingly the cowherd came in and asked his wife what had brought the justice there. She replied--For some reason or other he is angry with his son, who coming here entered our house and was protected by me by being concealed in the barn. His father searching for him did not find him in the house. Hence it is that the magistrate is going in a rage. She then took out the son from the barn and showed him. So it is said--
The food of women is twofold, their readiness of wit fourfold, perseverance sixfold and passion eightfold.
Therefore I say-'He, whose intellect does not fail him. &c.' Karataka observed-Be it so. But how will it be possible to dissolve the great friendship that has grown up between them by the similarity of their dispositions? Damanaka replied--Let a remedy be applied. For it is said--
;hitoeng060.txt

60
What is possible to be accomplished by stratagem cannot be effected by exploits: a crow brought about the destruction of a black serpent by means of a gold chain.
Karataka asked how it was. Damanaka related--
FABLE VII.
A pair of crows lived in a certain tree. Their youngs were eaten by a cobra who lived in the hollow of the tree. Thereafter, the female crow, when again breeding said to her mate--My dear, let us abandon this tree. As long as the serpent lives here, our offspring can never live. For,
[Page 52]
A wicked wife, a cunning friend, an insolent servant, and a
residence in a house infested by a cobra, mean undoubtedly death
Don't you be afraid, my dear, replied the crow. I have pardoned his great crime again and again. But it shall not be tolerated now. The female crow observed--How will you be able to contend with one who is powerful? The crow replied--Away with this doubt. For,
He who has talent has strength; how can he, who is without talent, have strength? Behold, a haughty lion was killed by a hare. The female asked how that was, whereupon the male thus related--
FABLE VIII.
On the mountain named Mandara there dwelt a lion Durdanta by name, who always used to slaughter the beasts. Then all the beasts having assembled together made this representation to the lion--Sovereign of the beasts, why are so many animals slaughtered at a time? If it please Your Highness, we ourselves shall send one beast every day for your food. To this the lion replied--If you desire it let it be done. Thenceforth he ate one animal that was offered him. Now one day the lot fell on an aged hare. He meditated--
It is in the hope of saving one's life that a supplication is made to the source of fear:--If I am to die why should I conciliate the lion?
I shall go then slowly. The lion who was oppressed with hunger, asked him in anger--Why hast thou come so late? The hare replied--My lord, I am not to blame. On my way I was forcibly seized by another lion. Having pledged my word that I would return to him I have come here to represent it to Your Highness. The lion said
;hitoeng061.txt

61
in a passion--Go quickly and show the vile wretch to me. Where does the villain live? Then the hare taking the lion with him set out to show him a deep well. Please Your Highness, come here and behold him yourself.' With these words he showed him the lion's own reflection in the water of the well. Thereupon he, being swollen with rage, sprang upon him through arrogagance and lost his life. Therefore I say, he who has talent has strength &c. The female crow said I have heard everything Now tell me what I am to do. The crow replied--The prince comes every day and bathes in the adjacent tank. Hold up in your bill a gold necklace, which is taken off from his person at the time of bathing and placed on a stone of the flight of steps, and put it in this hollow. Now on one occasion when the prince had entered the water for bathing, the female crow did what she was directed to do. Then by the servants of the prince who followed the track of the gold necklace, the serpent was seen and killed. Hence I say--What is possible to be accomplished
by means of a remedy &c. Karataka said--If it is so, you may
[Page 53]
May your efforts be crowned with suocess! Then Damanaka went to Pingalaka, bowed, and said--Please Your Highness, I have come here perceiving that some calamity, leading to great disaster, is imminent, For,
A well-meaning man should give his wholesome counsel even unasked, in the case of a calamity, when a man swerves from the right path, or when the time of taking action is passing away. Again,
The proper sphere of the king is to enjoy pleasures, while that of the minister is to attend to business. A minister who spoils the business of state is to blame in every way.
This is the proper duty of ministers--
Better is the abandonment of life or the cutting off of the head than the neglect of one who desires to commit the sin of obtaining his master's post.
Pingalaka asked him graciously--Now what do you wish to say? Damanaka replied--My lord, Samjivaka appears to be acting in an unbecoming manner towards Your Highness. To speak clearly, he, having cast reproach on Your Highness' three powers, wishes to gain the sovereignty itself. On hearing that Piigalaka stood quite full of wonder mingled with fear. Damanaka observed again--My lord, that Your Highness, having
;hitoeng062.txt

62
dismissed all ministers, placed him alone at the head of all affairs, was in itself a blunder. For--
The goddess of royalty stands having placed her feet on a minister when very highly exalted and the king; but she, unable long to bear the burden, being of the nature of a woman, gives up one of the two. Moreover,
When a king makes one minister the (sole) authority in a kingdom, vanity takes possession of him through delusion, and he alienates himself (from the king) through indolence brought on by vanity; when (once) alienated, a desire for independence springs up in his mind; and then led by the desire for independence he (the minister) acts treacherously even to the extent of robbing the king of his life. Again,
Of rice tainted with poison, of a tooth got loose and of a minister turned a traitor, complete eradication leads to happiness. Also, -127.
[Page 54]
A king, who places his royal fortune under his minister's control, will, in the event of his (minister's) being in calamity, experience trouble like a blind man without guides.
He proceeds in (conducts) all affairs according to his will. Your Highness, therefore, is the authority is to decide as to what is to be done under these circumstances. As for myself
Now this--
There is not that man in this world who does not covet riches: who, in this world, does not wistfully look at the youthful and charming wife of another?
The lion observed reflecting--Dear Damanaka, although such is the case, still great is the affection that I have for Samjivaka. Behold!
Although committing offences, a favourite is a favourite : who does not like the body although affected with all humours? Again,
He who is dear is so although doing unpleasant things; who has disregard for (has not to do with) fire although it has consumed all the substance in the house?
Damanaka replied--My lord, and just therein lies the fault. For,
He on whom the king fixes his eye more (than on others)-- be he a son, or a minister, or a stranger-is resorted to by the goddess of wealth. May Your Highness listen--
;hitoeng063.txt

63
The result of what is wholesome although unpleasant, is happy: riches delight (to live) there where there is a speaker and a hearer (of things wholesome though disagreeable).
You, having discarded old servants, advanced this stranger. And this was a wrong step. For,
Having cast off old servants one should not honour strangers: because there is no other fault so destructive to royalty than this.
The lion said--What wonder! Since he was brought here by me having pledged my word of safety and was well taken care of, how can he turn a traitor to me? Damanaka observed--
Sire,
A wicked man, even though served every day, reverts to his natural disposition, like a dog's tail resuming (its natural) bent, notwithstanding such remedies as causing sweat (by fumigation) and rubbing it with unguents (for making it straight). Again,
A dog's tail, made to sweat, rubbed and bound round with strings, returned to its nature when set free (even) after twelve years.
Moreover,
Whence can advancement or bestowal of honour please the wicked? Poisonous trees, although watered with nectar, do not bring forth fruit wholesome to eat.
Hence my observation--
One should say what is beneficial to him whose ruin one does not wish; this is the duty of the good; the contrary is otherwise (i. e is the way of action of bad men). - 138.
It is said in connexion with this--
[Page 55]
He has affection (for us) who dissuades (us) from evil; that is an act which is pure; she is a wife, who is obedient; he is talented who is esteemed by the good; that is wealth which begets no vanity; he is happy who is free from desire; he is a friend who is sincere (lit. artless); and he is a man who is not troubled by the senses (i. e. has his senses under control).
If Your Highness who stands in imminent danger from Samjivaka, does not turn back after being warned (lit. informed), then the blame does not lie with a servant like myself.
A king who is addicted to carnal pleasures does not mind the business he has to attend to or his good, but led by his free
;hitoeng064.txt

64
will he acts as he likes like a mad elephant; but when, puffed up with pride, he falls into the abyss of sorrow, he casts the blame on his servants, but does not take into account his own misconduct.
Pingalaka (To himself)--
One should not inflict punishment upon others by (listening to) the adverse representation of another : but having ascertained the truth for oneself, one shonld mete out punishment or praise.
Similarly it is said--
To award favour or punishment without ascertaining one's merit or fault is not the policy: (such a course) leads to one's destruction like the hand thrust into a serpent's month through vanity.
(Aloud) What then, shall Samjivaka be warned (against such a course of conduct)? Damanaka observed in haste--Not so, not so my lord. This will mean the divulging of counsel. For it is said--
The seed of counsel should be kept concealed in such a way that not even a glimpse of it could get out; if got out it will not thrive. Moreover,
If what is to be taken or given or done be not quickly attended to, time saps its juice.
[Page 56]
Therefore what is set on foot should necessarily be accomplished with a mighty effort. Again,
Counsel, like a timid warrior, although having all the parts well covered, is not able to keep up long for fear of being penetrated by others (the enemies).
And if a reconciliation is to be sought with him (the bull), after his offence has been known, he being made to turn back from such a wrong course of conduct, that would be extremely impolitic. For,
He who wishes to conciliate a friend once estranged invites death itself like a she-mule conceiving a fætus.
The lion said--Let it be first ascertained what harm he is able to do us. Damanaka replied—-My lord,
How can one's power be ascertained unless the relation of principal and subordinate is known? Behold how an insignificant bird like a tittibha (a lap-wing) overpowered the sea.
The lion asked how it was. Damanaka related--
;hitoeng065.txt

65
FABLE IX,
A pair of tittibhas lived on the shore of the southern sea. The female when near her delivery said to her husband--My dear, find out a retired place convenient for my delivery. The male said--My dear, this very place is surely fit for your delivery. She replied--This place is washed over by the tide. The male observed--What? Am I so powerless that the sea should insult me, stationed in my own house? The female said smiling--My lord, vast is the difference between the sea and yourself. Or rather,
It is difficult to form a correct estimate of one's self--whether one is capable (of achieving a thing) or not: he who has such knowledge does not experience trouble even in a difficulty.
The beginning of an unworthy act, opposition to one's relatives, emulation with the stronger, and confidence in young women—-these are four doors to death.
Then following (with difficulty) the advice of her husband she laid her eggs there. Having heard all that, the sea too, wishing to know their strength, carried off their eggs. Then the female tittibha, smitten with grief, said to her husband-Lord, evil has befallen us. Those my eggs are lost. The male said-Fear not, my dear. With these words he called together a council of birds and repaired into the presence of Garuda, the king of the feathered tribes. On reaching the place, the tittibha related the whole affair before the divine Garuda (saying)-- 
[Page 57]
Lord, without any fault, I, who was stationed in my house, was
wronged by the sea. Having heard his words, Garuda besought the Lord, the divine Narayana, the author of the creation, preservation and destruction of the universe, who ordered the sea to restore the eggs. Then having placed on the crown of his head (obeyed with deep reverence) the divine order, the sea returned the eggs to the tittibha. Hence I say--Without knowing the relation of principal and subordinate, &c. The king asked--How is it to be known that he is maliciously disposed (towards me)? Damanaka replied--Your Highness will know it when he, full of pride, will approach you, ready to strike with the tips of his horns and like one dismiayed (or bewildered). Having uttered these words, he went to Samjivaka. On reaching the place, he, approaching gently, presented himself like one amazed. Samjivaka inquired with affectionate regard--Friend, are you
;hitoeng066.txt

66
happy ? Damanaka replied--How can there be any happiness for servants? For,
The riches of those who are in royal service are in another's power; their mind is always uneasy, and they have no surety even of their lives. Moreover, -150.
Who, having obtained wealth, does not become proud? The miseries of what sensualist have come to an end? Whose mind is not wounded by woman? Who is a favourite of kings? Who has not fallen into the clutches of Death? What supplicant has met with honour, and what man, fallen into the meshes of the wicked, has escaped unscathed?
Samjivaka said--Friend, speak out what this means. Damanaka replied--What should I say, an unfortunate creature! Behold,
Just as a man plunged into the sea having obtained the support of a serpent, does neither give it up nor hold fast to it, so bewildered am I now. For,
On the one hand is the royal confidence betrayed, on the other, a friend perishes: what shall I do, and where shall I go, I who am fallen into the sea of trouble?
With these words he heaved a deep sigh and sat down. Samjivaka said--Still, friend, tell me in detail what you have at heart. Damanaka said with (a show of) great secrecy--
Although I must not betray the king's secret, yet you have come here through confidence in us; and I, as desiring the next world, must necessarily tell you what concerns your welfare. Listen. This our Lord, being prejudiced against you, said in private--I will kill Samjivaka himself and treat my attendants (with his flesh). Samjivaka, on hearing this, was smitten with great sorrow. Damanaka observed again--Away with sorrow. Do what the time demands. Samjivaka, after a moment’s reflection, said--This is, indeed, well said--
[Page 58]
Women seek the company of wicked men; a king generally patronizes (or, lavishes wealth upon the undeserving; wealth seeks a miser; and the god of rain pours the showers on mountains and seas!
(To himself) Now it is not possible to decide from his manner of acting (or, conversing) whether this is his doing or not. For,
;hitoeng067.txt

67
Some wicked man possesses splendour (appears good amiable) from the beauty of his master (or patron, lit. the person he depends upon), like fool (black) collyrium when put into their eyes by young women.
After reflection; he says-Alas! What is this that has come to pass ! For,
A king, though served with assiduity, may not be pleased; where is the wonder in this? But this is some strange pattern of creation, who being served is turned into an enemy!!!
So this is a matter (lit. something to be understood by inference) which it is impossible to understand. For,
He who is displeased having some cause in view, is, indeed, pleased when that cause) is removed; but how can a man please him whose mind harbours enmity without cause?
What wrong did I do to the king? Or rather, kings are wont to do injury without any cause. Damanaka observed--It is just so. Listen
Even an act of kindness, done by man eminently learned and affectionate, becomes hateful; while an actual injury done by others is just regarded with pleasure: on account of difficulty of understanding the minds of kings which are unsteady (lit., not the abode of one feeling); the duty of servitude is extremely difficult, not to be comprehended even by Yogis (those who have attained superhuman powers).
Moreover,
A hundred obligations (or, services rendered) are lost upon the wicked; a hundred fine speeches upon the illiterate; a hundred words of advice upon those who would not act up to them; and a hundred counsels on the senseless. Again,
There are serpents on the sandal trees; lotuses grow in water wherein there are also alligators; and when one is in the enjoyment of a thing there are villains to obscure one's good qualities ; (so) pleasures are not without obstructions! And further, - 160.
[Page 59]
The root is infested by serpents, the flowers by bees, the branches by monkeys and the tops by bears; thus there is nothing belonging to the sandal tree that is not resorted to by very cruel and murderous animals.
As for our master, I have known him to be honeyed in speech but carrying poison in the heart. For,
;hitoeng068.txt

68
He raises his hand from a distance (by way of greeting) and has his eyes moist (with tears of joy); he proffers half of his seat, he is ready to give a close embrace, shows great regard in making inquiries and talking about one's beloved persons, hes poison inside, but is all sweetness from outside, and is an expert in deceit (or dissembling ): what pantomimic art is this, unheard of before, that has beon learnt by the wicked ?
To make matters clear
For crossing the impassable sea there is the boat (provided), the lamp against the approach of darkness, the fan when there is absence of breeze and the goad for quelling the pride of elephants stupified by rut: thus there is nothing on earth, to provide a remedy against which, care bas not been taken by the Oreator; but, methinks, even the Creator is foiled in his efforts to dispel the (evil) tendencies of the minds of the wicked.
Samjivaka, heaving a sigh again—Alas! Oh, pity! that I, as corn-eater, should be falled by a lion!! For,
Between those two only whose wealth is equal, or whose power is equal, a dispute can well be understood; but never between the best and the worst.
(Reflecting again) I do not know who has set (poisoned the mind of) this king against me. One has to be always in dread of a king whose feelings are estranged. For,
When a king's mind has once been alienated from his minister who can re-unite it, like a crystal bracelet when broken? Moreover,
The thunderbolt and kingly power-—these two are extremely terrible: but the one falls in one place, the other (exerts its influence) all round.
Death in battle, therefore, should be accepted. It will not be proper for me, now, to act in obedience to his commands. Because,
If dead, he (a brave warrior) attains heaven; if he kills the foe he obtains happiness: these two advantages, which the valiant possess, are very rare.
And this is the fit time for battle.
When out of battle death is certain, but in battle life is doubtful (there is some chance of living), then that, the wise declare to be the time for battle. For,
;hitoeng069.txt

69
When a wise man sees no benefit accruing to himself from not fighting, he dies fighting the foe.
[Page 60]
In case of victory, he (a warrior) obtains fortune; if he dies, a heavenly damsel: when the bodies are perishable in a moment, what hesitation should there be about dying in battle? -170.
Having pondered thus, Samjivaka said--Friend, how am I to know that he is bent on (lit., desirous of) killing me? Damanaka replied - When he, with his tail erect, his (fore)-paws lifted up and his mouth wide open, will look at you, you too should display your prowess. For,
To whom is a man, powerful yet void of fire (spirit, energy) not an object of contempt? Lo, people fearlessly set their foot upon a heap of ashes.
But all this must be done with the strictest privacy; otherwise, not you, not I (i. e., it will be all over with us both). Having said these things Damanaka went to Karataka.
Karataka asked him--What is the outcome (of your efforts)? Damanaka replied--A reciprocal breach (of friendship) has been effected as intended. Karataka observed--What doubt can there be as to that! For,
Who, possibly, is a friend of the wicked? Who will not get angry when pressed with great importunity? Who does not become proud on account of wealth, and who is not clever in doing an evil deed? Moreover,
A wealthy man is led into vice by artful men for self-aggrandizement: what mischief does not the company of villains do, like fire?
Damanaka then repaired to Pingalaka, and saying--My lord, the villain (lit., the vile intentioned one) is coming; do you therefore prepare yourself and wait—he made him assume the attitude described before. Samjivaka too, on coming there, saw the lion with altered features in that way and displayed his valour in a manner worthy of himself. Then in the fierce battle that ensued Samjivaka was killed by the lion.
Now Pingalaka, after he had slain Samjivaka and taken rest, stood like one sorrow-smitten and said--What a cruel deed have I done! For,
When a king transgresses his duty, his kingdom is enjoyed by others; while he himself is the abode of sin, like a lion that kills an elephant.*
The lion kills the elephant and remains guilty of the murder, while the tusks and bones of the elephant are obtained by others.
;hitoeng070.txt

70.
When there is loss of a part of one's territory, or, of a servant meritorious and gifted with intellect, the loss of the servant is death to a king: land though lost may easily be acquired, but not servants.
Damanaka observed--My lord, what a novel course of action is this, that having killed an enemy you should be sorrowing over it! For it is said--
A king who desires his own welfare should put to death those who aim at his life, whether it be his father, or brother, or son or friend.
Moreover,
One, who knows the real nature of Dharma, Artha and Kama, should not be exclusively merciful; for a man given to forgiveness is not able to save even the thing in his hand. Also,
[Page 61]
Forgiveness shown to friend or foe is an ornament in the case of hermits, while the same when shown to offenders by kings is a blemish. Again,
There is only one expiation for him who, through lust of sovereignty or pride, covets his master's post, viz., the relinquishing of life (capital punishment) and none else.
A sovereign who is merciful, a Brahmana eating every thing (or, very greedy), a wife not under control, a companion of evil conduct, a servant who is impertinent (lit., going against his master's orders) and an officer who is careless--these should be abandoned, as well as he who is ungrateful.
Particularly,
Truthful and (also) false (when necessary), now harsh and now of sweet address, cruel, and also merciful (at times), now economical (lit., devoted to saving money), anon liberal, ever spending and yet getting money and jewels in plenty-royal policy, like a harlot, puts on a variety of forms.
Thus consoled by Damanaka, Pingalaka regained his natural equanimity and sat on the throne. Damanaka, delighted at heart, said--Victory to the king! May the worlds be happy! and lived in happiness according to his wishes,
Vishusarma said--You have heard the separation of Friends! The Princes replied--Yes, we have by your favour, and have been happy. Vishusarma said--Let there be this much in addition--
;hitoeng071.txt

71
As for the separation of friends, let it be in the house of your enemies; let villains being drawn away by the god of death meet with destruction day by day; may the people ever be the asylum of prosperity and happiness of every kind; and let young boys always sport in the delightful garden of stories. -182.
Chapter III.
WAR.
At the time of narrating the stories again, the princes said--Venerable Sir, we are princes. We have, therefore, a curiosity to hear about War. Vishnusarma said I will relate just what your honours like. Do you hear about (the subject of) War then, of which this is the first Sloka--
In the combat between the swans and the peacocks, in which equal valour was displayed, the swans were deceived, their confidence being gained by the crows, having resided in the enemy's house.
[Page 62]
The princes asked--How was that? Vishnusarma related as follows--There is, in Karpuradvipa, a lake, known as Padmakeli. In it dwelt a royal swan, Hiranyagarbha by name. He was installed their king by all the aquatic birds having assembled together. For,
If there be no king to guide the subjects properly, they would sink (in misery) in this world, like a boat without a helmsman in the sea. Moreover,
The king protects the subjects; they enrich the king: protection is better than enrichment: for in its absence, even what is, is not (i.e, no property is secure).
One day that royal swan was sitting at ease on a large lotus-couch surrounded by his retinue, when a crane, Dirghamukha by name, coming from some country, made his obeisance and sat down. Dirghamukha, said the king, you have come from a foreign country. Tell us the news. The crane replied, sire, there is great news and I have hastened here to communicate that. May Your Highness listen. There is a mountain, Vindhya by name, in Jambudvipa, where lives a peacock, Chitravarna by name, king of birds. While roaming in Dagdharanya, I was observed by his attendant birds and asked--Who are you and where have you come from? Whereupon
;hitoeng072.txt

72
I replied--I am a follower of his Imperial Majesty, the royal swan, Hiranyagarbha, king of Karpuradvipa and have come here out of curiosity to see foreign countries.
On hearing this, the birds asked me--Which of the two countries and kings you think to be the better? I replied--Why is the question necessary? Great is the difference. Karpuradvipa is heaven itself, while the royal swan is the second lord of heaven. Condemned to this desolate place, what do you do here? Come away; let us go to our country. Then on hearing my words all flew into a passion. For,
To feed serpents on milk is simply to add to their poison : advice given to fools leads to provocation and not to satisfaction.
Moreover,
A learned man only should be advised, and never an illiterate one; for having offered advice to monkeys, the birds had to go away being deprived of their place of abode.
The king asked how it was. Dirghamukha thus related--
FABLE I.
There is a large Salmali tree on the bank of the Narmada,
[Page 63]
in the vicinity of a hill. There, in the interiors of nests built
by themselves lived certain birds in happiness even in the monsoons. Once in the rainy season, the sky being overoast with masses of clouds looking like so many dark veils, there fell a heavy shower of rain in large streams. Then the birds seeing some monkeys at the foot of the tree, suffering from cold and shivering, said, through mercy-Ho monkeys, hear--
We have built nests with straws brought by means of nothing else but our bills: why do you (then), who are endowed with hands and feet, experience suffering?
Hearing this, the monkeys being enraged said to themselves-Oh, the birds comfortably lodged in the interior of their neats not exposed to the blast, are reproaching us! Well, let the showers just cease. Thereafter, when the downpour of rain had stopped, the monkeys climbed up the tree, and smashed all the nests, so that the eggs of the birds fell down. Hence I say--A learned man only should be advised &c. What did they do then?--asked the king. The crane replied--Then the birds said, in anger--Who made the royal swan king? Thereupon I too being irritated asked them--By whom was your
;hitoeng073.txt

73
peacock made king? Hearing this they all beoame ready to kill me, whereupon I also displayed my valour. For,
On other occasions forbearance is an ornament to men as modesty is to women; but on the occasion of an insult a heroic action is an ornament as boldness (absence of modesty) is to a woman at the time of sexual enjoyment.
The king smiled and observed
He, who having well considered his own strength or weakness as well as that of his enamies is not at all able to mark the difference, is despised by the enemies. Again,
A stupid ass, that daily fed upon corn in a field for a long time, being covered with a tiger's skin, suffered death for the fault of his voice.
The crane asked how it was. The king related--
FABLE II.
There lived, in Hastinapura, a washerman, Vilasa by name. His arm had become feeble on account of carrying burdens too heavy for him and was almost at the point of death. Thereapon the washerman, having wrapped him up in a tiger's skin, let him loose in a corn-field near a forest. Now the master of the field seeing him from a distance used quickly run away
[Page 64]
taking him for a tiger. Then, one day, one of the men setting guard over the corn having protected his body with a dusky blanket and got a bow and arrow ready, remained waiting in a corner with his body bent down (in a bent posture). Seeing him from a distance the donkey who had grown stout and gained strength by eating corn at pleasure thought him to be a female ass and setting up a loud bray ran towards her. The corn-keeper knowing for certain from his braying that it was an ass killed him easily. Hence I say--A stupid ass, that daily fed on corn &c. What next? Dirghamukha replied--Then the birds said--Ah villain, vile crane, treading on our ground, thou revilest our lord ! This cannot be borne now. With these words all of them pecked at me with their bills and said wrathfully--Look here, thou blockhead, that swan, thy king, is extremely mild. He has no claim at all to sovereignty.
For he who is all mildness is not able to save even the thing on the palm of his hand. How can he govern the earth then, or what is a kingdom to him? You too are a frog in a well
;hitoeng074.txt

74
(an inexperienced fellow) and hence you advise us to seek his shelter. Listen--
A large tree, endowed with fruit and shade, should be resorted to: if, through ill luck, there be no fruit who can take off the shade? Moreover,
A mean person should not be served; shelter should be taken with a great man; (for) even milk in the hands of a liquor-selling-woman is said to be (taken for) wine.
The extent (lit, multitude) of merits, although great, shrinks into smallness when coming in contact with one void of merits, by the relation of the receiver and the received, like a large elephant in a mirror. Especially,
When a king is very powerful, success can be obtained even by using a fiction: the hares lived happily by the fiction (fictitiously representing themselves as the servants) of the moon.
I asked how it was; and the birds related--
FABLE III.
Once upon a time, as there was no rain even in the rainy season, a herd of elephants, being oppressed with thirst, said to their chief-Lord, what means have we to save our lives? There is a place here (only) for little creatures to bathe; but for want of a bath we are as though blind; so whither can we go? What can we do? Thereupon the lord of the herd, going to a place not very far off, showed them a pond full of clear water. Then, as days passed on, the little hares that lived on its bank were crushed by the treadings of the elephants. Upon this a hare, Silimukha by name, thus deliberated. This herd of elephants, being troubled by thirst, must be coming here every day and thus our race is destroyed. Then a certain old hare, Vijaya by name, said--Be not sorry. I will remedy this. He then set out, having undertaken to achieve that. On his way he reflected. How shall I stand before the herd of elephants and address them--For,
An elephant kills though only touching; a serpent when simply smelling; a king though smiling; and a wicked man although (outwardly) showing honour.
[Page 65]
I shall, therefore, mount the top of the hill and address the
leader of the herd. That being done, the leader of the herd asked him--Who are you and where have you come from? He
;hitoeng075.txt

75
replied, I am a hare sent to you by the divine Moon. Declare your purpose, said the chief of the herd. Vijaya replied--
A messenger never speaks falsely even though weapons be raised against him: for he always declares the truth on account of the immunity from being killed which he always enjoys.
I, therefore, speak by his order. Listen. You did not act properly inasmuch as you caused the hares, the guardians of the Moonlake, to be dispersed. For these hares have long been my proteges. Hence it is that I am called Sasanka (the hare-emblemed). When the messenger had thus declared himself, the head of the herd said thus in terror--This was done in ignorance, I will not go there again. The messenger said--If so, pay your homage to the lord Moon, trembling with anger in the lake, and having (thus) propitiated him, you may go. Then at night the chief of the herd was taken to the pond there shown the tremulous disk of the moon (reflected) in the water and made to bow down. The messenger said--Lord, he committed the fault through ignorance; he should, therefore, be forgiven. He will not do so a second time. With these words he was sent away. Hence I say--When the king is very powerful, success can be obtained &c. Then I said--That royal swan, our master, alone is mighty in valour and is exceedingly powerful. Even the sovereignty of the three worlds would become him, what of a kingdom then! Thereupon the birds, saying--
"Villain, what business have you to tread on our ground?" took me to king Chitravarna. Then having presented me before the king they said after bowing-Sire, please note--this wicked crane, although travelling in our country, speaks contemptuously of your Majesty's feet. The king demanded who I was and where, I came from. They replied--He is an attendant of the royal swan, Hiranyagarbha by name, and has come here from Karpuradvipa. Thereafter, the minister, a vulture, asked me--Who is the prime minister there? I replied--A Chakravaka, named Sarvajna(all-knowing), who is an adept in the principles of all the Sastras (sciences). The vulture remarked--This is proper. He is a native of the same country.
A king should fittingly appoint, as his minister, one who is born in the same country, who is nobly bred (lit. observes the family practices, or who is nobly born and of virtuous conduct; see com.), who is pure and of tried honesty, who is a sound counsellor, who is not addicted to vices and does not swerve
;hitoeng076.txt

76
from the right path, who has mastered the law relating to disputes, who is hereditary, reputed, learned and an expert in raising revenue.
Just then a parrot observed--Please Your Highness, Karpuradvipa and other small countries are inciuded in Jambudvipa and therefore the authority of Your Highness extends over them also. To this the king replied that it was so. For,
A king, a mad man, a child, a young woman, and one lated with the pride of wealth, desire what is unattainable;
how much more so then what can be certainly obtained?
[Page 66]
To this I said--If by mere words one's sovereignty  can be established, our lord Hiranyagarbha too has mastery over Jambudvipa.
The parzot said--How can this matter be decided? I replied--By war. The king said smilingly--Go and ask your king to be ready.
Then I said--You should send your ambassador also. The king asked--Who will go as an ambassador? For a person of this description should be appointed an ambassador.
A messenger should be devoted to his master, pure (or, honest), diligent, bold, unaddicted to vices, forgiving, a Brahmana, one knowing the weak points (or, secrets of the enemy and ready-witted,
The vulture observed--Many are fit to be ambassadors, no doubt; but a Brahmana alone should be preferred. For,
He pleases his master and does not aim at his wealth: the blackness of Kalakuta (a kind of deadly poison) does not vanish even by its contact with Isvara (Siva). - 20.
The king-Let the parrot go then. Parrot, you yourself then go with him and declare our will. The Parrot--As Your Majesty commands. But this crane is a villain; I will not go with him. For, it is said--
A wicked man commits an evil deed, while its consequences are sure to be suffered by the good. Ravana carried away Sita, while the great ocean suffered confinement (had a bridge built over it). Moreover,
One should not, in any case, live with a wicked man: from their contact with a crow were killed a goose who lived with him and a quail for going on a journey with him.
;hitoeng077.txt

77
The king asked how that was, whereupon the parrot related--
FABLE IV.
There is a large fig-tree in a forest bordering on the road leading to Ujjayini, upon which lived a goose and a crow. One day in the sultry season, a traveller, being fatigued, slept under the treo, having placed a bow and arrow by his side. After a short while the shadow of the tree moved away from his face. Then, seeing that his face was covered with the sun, a swan, that lived on the tree, through mercy, spread his wings and shaded his face again. Thereafter the traveller, happy in the enjoyment of sound sleep, yawned. Now the crow, unable to bear the happiness of others, through the wickedness natural to his species, muted into his mouth and flew away. Thereupon, as soon as the traveller rose and looked up, he saw the goose whom he killed with an arrow. Hence I say--One should not live with a wicked man. I will also relate the story of the quail.
FABLE V.
[Page 67]
Once upon a time all the birds went to the sea-side, on a pilgrimage in honour of Garuda (the divine Eagle). Among them a quail travelled with a crow. Now the crow repeatedly ate of the curds in a pot which a cowherd was carrying on his head. Thereupon, as he placed his pot on the ground and looked up, the cowherd saw the crow and the quail. The crow being affrighted by him flew away, while the quail being slow of flight was caught and put to death. Hence I say--One should neither live nor go with &c. I then observed--Brother parrot, why do you talk so? I esteem you as much as I do His Majesty. The parrot replied--Be it so; but--
Even sweet things accompained with smiles, said by the wicked, certainly cause fear, like flowers appearing out of season.
As for your wickedness, that was known from your very speech, since your words are the cause of the fight between these two kings. See--
A fool is pleased by conciliatory words, even though an offence be committed before his eyes: (as was) 8 wheel-wright (who) took on his head his wife with her paramour. The king asked how that was, upon which the parrot related--
;hitoeng078.txt

78
FABLE VI.
There was a wheel-wright in the town of Yauvanasri named Mandamati (Dull-wit). He knew his wife was false, but had never seen her, with his own eyes, with her lover in the same place. Then the wheel-wright saying that he was going to a village set out, but after having gone some way he returned secretly and hid himself in his house under the cot. Now the wife of the wheel-wright, confident that he had gone to another village, called her lover just in the evening. There after, as she was sporting heartily with him on the cot, she got a slight touch of his (the wheel-wright's) body as he lay under the cot, and feeling sure that it was her husband, became disconcerted. Thereupon the gallant asked her-Why don't you sport with me lustily to-day but appear to be bewildered? To this she replied--You are quite ignorant of the truth. He who is the lord of my life, and with whom I have been in friendship from childhood has gone to a village. Without him, this village, although full of people, is to me as a desert. How has he fared in that strange place? What has he eaten ? How has he managed for his bedding ?- with such thoughts is my mind distracted. What then, asked the gallant, is that wheel-wright such an object of love to you? The whore replied--You blockhead, why do you chatter thus? Listen--
She, who, although addressed in harsh words or looked at with angry eyes, receives her husband with a cheerful countenance, is the abode of religious merit.
[Page 68]
The worlds of great bliss are (in reserve) for those women who love their husband, whether living in a city or a wilderness, whether reprobate or virtuous. Again,
The husband is the most precious ornament of a woman althogh without (other) ornaments: for without him, she, even though decorated, is without grace.
You are a paramour. Through levity of heart, I sometimes consort with you, as I would chew a roll of betel-nut leaves no put on flowers. But he is my master, having power to sell me, or to give me away to the gods or the Brahmanas. In short, I live while he lives, and will die with him when he dies. This is my resolve. For,
For years three crores and a half-which is the number of hair on the human body--does a woman live in heaven, who follows her husband in death. Moreover,
;hitoeng079.txt

79
Just as a snake-catcher forcibly draws a serpent out of its hole, so does she take her husband to heaven and is exalted with him. Moreover,
The wife, who having clasped her dead husband on the funeral pyre quits her body, will, although she might have committed sins to be counted by hundreds, go to heaven with her husband.- 30.
Having heard all that, that wheel-wright said to himself--Blessed am I whose wife is so sweet-speaking and attached to her lord! With these thoughts in his mind, he having taken on his head the cot with the man and woman upon it danced with joy. Hence I say- A fool is pleased &c. I was then treated with the usual formalities by the king and dismissed. The parrot too is coming after me. All this being considered, let the course to be adopted be well attended to. The Chakravaka observed smilingly--Please Your Highnees, the crane, for one, has advanced Your Highness's interests to the best of his ability. But my lord, this is the nature of fools. For,
One should give a hundred but not quarrel—this is the opinion of the wise : but a strife without cause is the sign of the foolish.
The king remarked--What is the use of finding fault with the past? Let us attend to the matter in hand. Chakravaka--My lord, I will speak in private. For,
The wise read the thoughts of others from complexion, outward features and the echo of voice, as also from the movements of the eyes and the mouth: one should, therefore, hold a consultation in private.
[Page 69]
The king and the minister remained there; the rest withdrew to other places. The Chakravaka spoke--Sire, my idea is this--The crane has done this at the instigation of some one of our officers. For,
A sick man is most welcome to physicians, and such is one who is vicious (or, one in trouble) to the officers of state: the clever prey upon fools, while one of a high caste is the life of the good.
The king remarked--Be that as it may. The cause may be investigated afterwards. Just now let it be determined what steps we are to take. Chakravaka-My lord, let our spy first go
;hitoeng080.txt

80
there so that we may know of their doings as well as their strength and weaknees. For,
A spy is the eye of a king in the determinatior of what policy to pursue or what to abandon with regard to his own kingdom or that of his enemies: he who has it not is quite blind.
Let him, too, take with him a second person worthy of oonfidence, so that himself staying there he might very secretly ascertain the secret measures adopted by the enemy there, and having communicated the same to him, would send him here. For it is said
(A king ) should hold discourse with his spies gathered under the disguise of ascetics at some holy place or a hermitage or a temple with the (outward) object of learning the truths of the sastras.
A secret spy is one who can move in water or on land. Let that very crane, therefore be appointed. Let some such other crane go with him as his companion; and let the members of their families stay at the royal gate. But my lord, all thiş should be done, with the profoundest secrecy. For,
Counsel when reaching six years (if heard by a third person) leaks out as well as that got by hearsay: wherefore a king should deliberate with himself as the second (i. e. with his minister alone). Observe,
The evils resulting to a king from his counsels getting out are not capable of being remedied-such is the opinion of those who are versed in politics.
The king after reflecting--I have got the best emissary.
The minister--Then success in battle too is got.
Just then the door-keeper, having entered, said after bowing--Sire, a parrot who has come from Jambudvipa is waiting at the door. The king looked at Chakravaka. Chakravaka said--let him first go to the residence prepared for him and
[Page 70]
wait there. We shall send for him afterwards and grant him an interview. The door-keeper took the parrot to the residence and departed. The king--As for war it is imminent. Chakravaka--Still to go to war all at once is no wise policy. For,
Is he a servant or a counsellor, who, without due consideration, advises his sovereign at the outset to prepare for war or to quit his land? Moreover,
One should try to put down an enemy but never by means of fight: for victory in the case of combatants is always certain. Again,
;hitoeng081.txt

81
One should strive to subdue an enemy by conciliatory means, by gifts, by (sowing seeds of) discord-by all these simultaneously or singly—but never by battle. And further,
Every man is a hero as long as not engaged in a fight: who will not be proud that has not yet experienced the strength of his enemy (or, of another)? Moreover,
A stone is not raised by men so easily as it is with a pole (serving as a lever); great success by trifling means is the great fruit of counsel.
But seeing that war is at hand let the necessary steps be taken. For,
As husbandry becomes fruitful from labour spent upon it in due season, so, my lord, this policy (political measures) bears fruit after a long time (when the proper time comes), and not in a moment. Again,
Fearing a danger when at a distance but displaying bravery when it is at hand is a virtue that belongs to the great : a great man, in this world, conducts himself bravely in adversity.
Also,
Mental agitation is the first (greatest) obstacle to success of every kind: does not water, even though exceedingly cold, break through a mountain? More particularly because king Chitravarna is very powerful. For,
There is no ordinance to the affect that one should fight with the powerful: that fight which is between men and elephants must result in the destruction of the former. Again,-46.
[Page 71]
He is a fool who without getting the proper opportunity commences operations against his adversary: a strife with the powerful is like an insect getting wings (UAT v. l. like the exertions of an insect's wings, i. e. quite futile ). Moreover,
Having recourse to the tortoise's mode of contracting its body one should suffer even a blow: but when the right time comes, one, knowing the policy, should rise like a fierce cobra.
I invite your attention, my lord, to this,
One who knows how to use the proper remedies is able to uproot the great and the small equally, as is the current of a river which sweeps away the trees and grass.
For this purpose, let this parrot, the enemy's emissary, be given assurances and detained here until the fortress is prepared.
;hitoeng082.txt

82
For,
A single bowman standing on the battlement can fight a hundred, and, a hundred a hundred thousand : hence a fortress is set down as necessary. -50.
The territory of what king which is without strongholds is not liable to be conquered by the enemy? A king who has no fortress is helpless like a man fallen overboard.
One should build a castle with a large trench, furnished with lofty battlements, having machines, and a good supply of water and situated in a place sarrounded by hills, rivers and deserts.
Spaciousness, extreme difficulty of access (lit. ruggedness of the ground), a large store of water, grain and fuel and the means of ingress and egress-these seven are the precious possessions of a fort.
The king--Who should be entrusted with the work of getting the fortress ready? Chakravaka said--
One should employ a man in that business in which he is skilled. He who has no practical knowledge of a work gets bewildered (when set to it), although well versed in science.
Let Sarasa be called then. That being done, when Sarasa came the king looked at him and said--Sarasa, quickly attend to the fitting up of a fortress. Sarasa replied after bowing--
As for a fortress, Sire, I have long well marked this large lake as such; only let a stock of provisions be ordered to be laid up in the island which is in its centre. For,
The store of grains, O king, is the best of all stores; because
a jewel put into the mouth cannot support life.
Moreover,
[Page 72]
Of all spiced things salt is known to be the best : for a condiment taken without it tastes like cowdung (is quite insipid).
The king--Go and attend to everything with despath. The door-keeper having entered again--Sire, a crow, Meghavarna (cloud-colour) by name, who has come from Ceylon, is waiting at the gate with his retinue and wishes to see Your Majesty's feet. The king--A crow again knows everything and has a wide range of observation and is, for this reason, worthy of being retained. Chakravaka observed--Sire, this may be. But the
* By writers on military science.
;hitoeng083.txt

83
crow is a land-bird and is consequently set on the side of our enemies. How should he be admitted, then? For it is said--
That fool, who deserting his own side is attached to the enemy's party, is killed by the enemies, like the jackal with the blue colour.
The king asked how it was. The minister related--
FABLE VII.
A certain jackal that lived in a forest, fell, while wandering on the borders of a town, into an indigo-pot. Thereupon, not being able to get out of it, he feigned himself dead in the morning and so remained. Now the master of the indigo-pot, taking him to be dead, lifted him out of it, and carrying him to a distance, cast him off, whence he ran off. Then on going into the forest, and finding himself turned blue, he thus meditated--I have now got the best colour. Why should I not, then, secure my own exaltation? Having thus cogitated he called together the jackals and said I am installed king of the forest by the revered goddess of the woods with her own hands being anointed with the juice of the sarvaushadhi. Hence, from to-day all business should be carried on in the forest according to my orders. The jackals on their part, observing that he possessed the particular colour, prostrated themselves before him and said--It will be as Your Majesty commando. In the same way his sovereignty was gradually established over the other tenants of the forest. Thereafter being surrounded by his brethren he attained supreme power. After a while, having obtained servants of superior rank ench as the tiger, the lion and the like, he was ashamed to find the jackals in the court and discarded them with scorn. Then, finding the jackals dejected, an old jackal thus declared himself--Do not be sorry. Since by him who does not know his interest, we, who are well versed in policy and know his weak points, have been dismissed from his presence, that must be done by which he will perish. For these (nobler animals) the tiger and others, deceived by him mere colour and not recognizing him as a jackal consider him their king. Act, therefore, in such a way that he will be found out. To this end this should be done. That at the evening time you shall, all of you, set up a loud yell simultaneously in his hearing (lit. near him); so that on hearing that howl, he too following the natural disposition of his species, will utter a cry.
;hitoeng084.txt

84
For,
That which is the natural disposition of one is always hard to be got rid of. If a dog were made a king would he not gnaw a shoe?
Upon this, being discovered by his voice he will be killed by the tiger. Then that being done that happened (i. e. the plan being put into execution the event turned out as anticipated). For it is said--
[Page 73]
An enemy of our own tribe knows our weak points, our secrets, our valour-our everything, and when such a one is in our midst he burns, as fire in the interior does a dry tree.
I say, therefore,—That fool who having left off his own side &c. The king-Although this is the case, still he must be seen as he has come from a distance. We shall consider the question of his being retained here. The minister--Please Your Highness, the emissary has been sent and the castle put in readiness. Let the parrot, therefore, be granted an interview and dismissed. But, 
Chanakya killed Nanda through the agency of a sharp spy: one should, therefore, see an emissary, acoompanied by wise men and with brave men intervening. -60.
Thereafter a council being called, the parrot and the crow were sent for. The parrot, with his neck raised a little, sat on the seat that was offered him and said--His Imperial Majesty, the great Chitravarna commands you--If you care anything for your life or wealth, come quickly and bow to our feet; or else think of some other place to live in. The king said in a rage--Is there none among our servants here who will seize him by the neck (and turn him out)? Meghavarna rising--Sire, give but your command and I will kill the vile parrot. Sarvajna, having pacified the king and the crow, said-Please listen--
That is not an assembly which has no old men in it; those are not old men who do not declare what is just. That is no justice which has no truth in it; and that is not truth which borders on (leaves room for, partakes of fraud. And justice requires this--
A messenger, even though he be a Mlechchha (an out-caste) is exempt from being put to death; for a king has a messenger for his mouth (i.e. it is the king who speaks through his messenger).
;hitoeng085.txt

85
A messenger, does not speak otherwise (than directed) although weapons be raised against him. Moreover,
Who believes in his own inferiority or his enemy's superiority from the words of a messenger? For, from his nature of not being punishable by death, a messenger speaks anything and everything.
On hearing this the king and the crow were pacified (lit. were themselves again). The parrot, too, got up and went away. He was, however, brought back by Chakravaka, and after matters had been explained to him, was presented with gold ornaments and the like and dismissed, upon which he departed. The parrot having returned to the Vindhya mountain paid his respects to his sovereign. Seeing him the king Chitravarna asked him-What is the news? What sort of country is that?
The parrot replied--
Sire, in brief this is the news. Let preparations be made for war. As for the country of Karpuradvipa, it is (as it were) a part of heaven; how can it be possible to describe it? The King, on hearing this, sammoned all the principal persons together and sat down to deliberate with them. Said he--With reference to the war presently to be carried on, advise me as to what is proper to be done. As for war it is absolutely determined upon. For it is said:--
Brahmanas are ruined when discontented, and kings when contented, a harlot full of modesty is ruined and so are ladies of family, if without modesty.
[Page 74]
The vulture named Duradarsi (Far-seeing) observed--My lord it is not advisable to enter upon war under adverse circumstances, For,
When one's friends, ministers and allies are deeply attached, and of the enemy the reverse of this (i. e. disaffected with their sovereign), then only should war be made. Moreover,
(The acquisition of) land, an ally and gold--these three are the benefits accruing from war; when these can be counted upon as sure then only war should be made.
The King observed? Let the minister first inspect my forces, so that it may be known how far they will be useful. Similarly, let the astrologer be called who will determine and tell us the lucky time for starting. The minister--Still, to begin the expedition all at once is not advisable. For,
;hitoeng086.txt

86
Those fools, who without taking counsel rashly enter into the enemy's army, are sure to get an embrace with the edges of their swords.
The king said--Minister, do not at all damp my spirits. Tell me how one wishing for conquest invades his enemy's territory. The vulture replied I will tell you that. But it will yield fruit (prove beneficial) only if acted upon. For it is said--
What is the use of counsel given according to the Sastras (or, like the knowledge of the Sastras) to a king, if it be not acted upon? In no case can a disease be cured by the mere knowledge of medicine.
But as the command of a king is not to be transgressed, I will relate what I have learnt from the tests on the subject. Please to listen --
In rivers, mountains, wilds and difficult passes, wherever there is danger, O king, there the general should march with his forces drawn in battle-array.
The commander of the forces should march in the van, accompained by the flower of the army; in the middle should be stationed the women, the king, the treasury and the unimportant sections of the army.
On each flank the horse; on the sides of the horse the chariots; on both sides of the chariots the elephants, and on the flanks of the elephants the foot-soldiers.
In the rear should slowly march, O king, the commander-in-chief, accompained by ministers and brave warriors, cheering
those that are fatigued and backing the army. - 72
[Page 75]
One should traverse uneven ground abounding in water and full of hills by means of elephants, plains by means of horses, and rivers by means of boats, while the infantry should be employed in all place.
A march with elephants is said to be advantageous at the approach of the rainy season, with the horse at other times, and with foot-soldiers in all seasons.
In hills and difficult passes the king should be protected; and he should sleep wakefully even though guarded by brave men.
One should destroy and harass the enemy by hard-pressing him in difficult places; and at the time of entering into the enemy's country, the foresters should be placed foremost.
;hitoeng087.txt

87
Where the king is, there the treasure should also be; without the treasure there can be no royalty: from it (the treasure) the king should make payments to his servants: for who does not fight for one who gives (freely)? For,
Man is not the servant of men, O king, but he is the servant of money. Greatness or littleness too depends on the possession or absence of wealth.
They (the warriors) should fight in a compact body and defend one another; and whatever worthless portion of the army there may be should be placed in the middle of the column.
A king should place the infantry in the front of the army (or, send the infantry ahead of the army); he should wait having blocked up the enemy and also harass his country. Upon even ground he should fight with chariots and horses; in a place overflowing with water with boats and elephants; in a place covered with trees and shrubs, with bows; and on open land with swords, shields and other weapons.
He should ever and anon spoil his (enemy's) fodder, food, water and firewood; and demolish his tanks, ramparts and ditches. - 82.
The elephant forms the chief factor in a king's army: there is none other like him, because the elephant is said to possess eight weapons in his very limbs.
The cavalry is the strength of the army inasmuch as it forms a moving bulwark; a king, therefore, who is rich in cavalry, is victorious in a land-fight. For it is said--
Warriors fighting on horseback are difficult to be conquered even by the gods; the enemies, even though stationed at a distance, are (as it were) in their hands.
Striking the first blow in a battle, taking care of the whole army, and the clearing of roads in all directions--
(these three) they say, form the duty of the infantry.
[Page 76]
That army they declare to be the best, the soldiers in which are naturally brave, skilled in the use of weapons, loyal (lit. attached to their master), inured to fatigue and mostly drawn from the ranks of renowned Kshatriyas.
As men fight in this world, O king, by honour being shown to them by their lord, so they do not, oven by large sums of money being given to them.
;hitoeng088.txt

88
It is better to have a small army of chosen men than a multitude of heads: for the defeat of the weak will evidently lead to that of the strong.
Witholding of favour, not getting posts of honour*, seizing the portion due (to any one), delay (in payment or advancement) and non-retaliation (or, not redressing wrongs)-these are the causes of the disaffection of the troops. - 90.
One wishing to gain victory should attack his enemies without hard-pressing his own army: for the army of the enemies, when extremely wearied by long marches, can be easily overpowered.
There is no cleverer stroke of policy than a kinsman (of the enemy won over) causing the over-throw of an enemy: one should, therefore, set up, by all means, a kinsman of the enemy against him.
Having entered into a league with the heir-apparent or the principal minister (of the enemy), an invader who is steady of purpose, should cause internal dissentions (in his enemy's camps).
One should cause the destruction of a formidable ally (of his enemy) by giving him a defeat on the battlefield (or by fleeing before him and then suddenly turning upon him), or by seizing
his cattle and capturing his principal men and dependants.
[Page 77]
A king should cause his country to be populated by men brought forcibly from other countries, or rather, by means of gifts and the bestowal of honour; for when replenished with subjects it proves prosperous.
The king observed--Ah, why waste more words on this?
The aggrandizement of one's power and the decline of that of the enemy--the accomplishment of these two is all policy : having put forth this pre-eminently, those versed in policy display great eloquence (lit. play the Brihaspati).
The minister observed with a smile--All this is true, but--
Unrestrained might is one thing, while might guided (or governed) by (the principles of) science is quite another: for whence can there be the existence of light and darkness in one and the same place?
Then the king, having got up set out at the auspicious hour
declared by the astrologers.
*Lit. Non-leadership. + Or, one should cause internal discord (in the camps of) an invader who is &c.
;hitoeng089.txt

89
Now the spy despatched by his emissary came to Hiranyagarbha and said--Sire, king Chitavarna is almost arrived. Now he is on the table-land of the Malaya mountain with his army encamped there. The castle should be carefally searched every moment: for, the vulture is a great statesman and in the course of his confidential talk with some one, I came to know his secret that he had already placed some one in our castle. My lord, said Chakravaka, that could be the crow alone. It can never be, remarked the king. For, if this were the case, how could he have shown readiness to punish the parrot? Besides, it
[Page 78]
was after the departure of the parrot, that an eagerness for war
was displayed there, while he is here for a long time. The minister remarked--Still a stranger must be suspected. The king rejoined-Even strangers are sometimes observed to be benefactors. Listen--
Even a stranger doing good is a relative, while a relative doing harm is a stranger (an enemy); a disease taking its birth in the body is injurious, while a medicinal herb produced in the forest is salutary. Moreover,
There was a servant of the king Sudraka, Viravara by name, who in a short time, offered up his son. Chakravaka asked how it was; the king related--
FABLE VIII.
Formerly I fell in love with Karpuramanjari, daughter of the royal gander, Karpurakeli by name, who lived in the pleasure-lake of king Sudraka. A certain prince, Viravara by name, coming from some country, approached the royal gate and addressed the porter thus--I, for one, am a prince whose object is wages (to seek service); procure me the sight of the king. Thereupon, he, being ushered into the royal presence by him, said--Sire, if you wish to engage me as a servant fix my salary. Sudraka asked--What is your salary? Viravara replied--Four hundred gold coins per day. The king demanded What are your accoutrements? Viravara replied--my two arms, and the third, my sword. The king said--This is not possible. On hearing that he bowed and departed. Now the ministers observed--Sire, having given him his four days' pay let us know his characteristic nature--whether he receives such salary usefully (deservedly), or without being of use. Then, in accordance with the ministers' advice,
;hitoeng090.txt

90
Viravara was called back and given a betel-nut-roll and four hundred coins of gold. The king very secretly watched the use he made of them. Half of the money Viravara gave to the gods and the Brahmanas; half of what remained to the distressed, and the remainder he spent in food and amusements. Having done all these daily duties he attended, sword in hand, at the king's door, day and night. He also went home whenever the king ordered him to do so.
Once, on the fourteenth night of the dark half of a month, the king heard a plaintive sound of lamentation. Sudraka asked--Who waits at the door? He replied--I, Viravara. The king said--Follow the sound of wailing. Saying, 'As Your Majesty commands', away went Viravara. Now the king reflected--It is not proper that I sent this prince, all alone, in the pitchy darkness. I will, therefore, go after him and see what this might mean. So the king, too, took his sword and went out of the city, following his course. Viravara, on reaching the place, saw a woman, endowed with beauty and youth and decorated with ornaments of every description, crying; and asked her--Who are you? Why do you weep? The woman replied--I am the goddess of royalty of this king, Sudraka. I have long lived in great happiness under the shadow of his arms, but now I shall (have to) go elsewhere. Viravara said--Where there is a possibility of danger there is also a remedy. By what means then will the stability of your divine self here be ensured? The goddess of royalty said--If you will offer up your son, Saktidhara, endowed with thirty-two auspicious marks, to the goddess Sarvamangala (presiding over all blessings), then I can again live here happily for a long time. Saying so she disappeared from view.
[Page 79]
Viravara then went home and roused his wife, who was asleep, and his son. They having shaken off their sleep rose and sat down. Viravara communicated to them all that the goddess had said to him.
Hearing that Saktidhara, being full of joy, said--Blessed am I, being such as will be useful for the preservation of our lord's sovereignty. Then father, what occasion is there for delay? The use of this body, in such a cause as this, whenever it may be, is praiseworthy, For--
A wise man should give up bis wealth and life for others; their abandonment in a good cause is better when destruction is certain.
;hitoeng091.txt

91
Saktidhara's mother remarked-If this is not to be done, then by what other act can a return be made for the high salary paid in gold? Having thus deliberated they all went to the temple of Sarvamangala. There having offered worship to the goddess, Viravara said–-goddess, be propitiated. May the great king Sudraka be ever triumphant (prosper)! Accept this offering. With these words he cut off his son's head. Then Viravara thought to himself-As for the salary received from the king, it has been repaid. Now that I have become sonless, life is but a mockery (miserable) with me. Thinking so he cut off his own head. Then his wife, too, being oppressed with grief for her husband and son, did the same. Having heard and seen all that, the king, filled with astonishment, said to himself--
Insignificant creatures, like myself, live and die: but there never has been nor will ever be, in this world, one like unto him.
So I shall have nothing to do with my kingdom, which is deserted by him. Then the sword was raised by Sudraka also to lop off his head. Now the goddess Sarvamangala, appearing in a visible form, seized the king by the hand and said--Son, I am pleased with thee. Desist from this adventure. Thy kingdom is secure even after thy death. The king prostrating himself before her said--O goddess, of what use is kingdom to me or what have I to do with life? If you wish to take compassion upon me, let this Viravara, with his wife and son, live (be reanimated) with the remnant of my life. Or else, I will pursue the course which has fallen to my lot. The goddess said--Son, by this noble generosity of thy heart and thy kindness to thy servants, I am pleased with thee in every way. Go and prosper. Let this prince, too, with his family, revive. With these words the goddess vanished from sight. Thereupon Viravara, being restored to life with his wife and son, went home. The king, too, quickly returned unobserved by them, and having entered the inner apartment of his palace slept as before. Now Viravara, on guard at the door, being again questioned by the king replied--My liege, the woman who was crying disappeared when she saw me. There is no further news. Hearing those words the king was pleased and said in astonishment--How praiseworthy is this magnanimous person! For,
Being generous he should speak sweetly; he should be valiant without boasting; he should be munificent, but without
;hitoeng092.txt

shedding his bounty on the unworthy; and he should be bold without being harsh.
All these characteristics of a great man are found in him. Then in the morning the king having called together a council of great men, narrated before them the whole account and bestowed on him the kingdom of Kornata, as a mark of his favour. What then, is a stranger wicked merely because of his nature (or class)? Even among these (strangers) there are those who are good, bad and middling. Chakravaka said--
[Page 80]
He is a bad minister (or, is he a minister) who, having
regard to the will of the king represents (recommends) what ought not to be done as propor to be done: better is the pain caused to the master's mind than his ruin brought about by his doing what is improper.
A king, whose physician, spiritual guide and minister are
flatterers, fast loses his health, his religious merit and treasure.
Hear, my liege.
'What was obtained by one through the force of merit I too shall gain'- A barber, who, through a varice, thus covetad a treasure, lost his life for having killed a mendicant. The King asked how that was. The minister related--
FABLE IX.
There was in the city of Ayodhya, a Kshatriya, by name Chudamani. He, longing after wealth, long worshipped Siva (lit. the god who has the crescent-moon for his crest-jewel) undergoing great bodily hardships. Thereafter when he was purified of his sins, the lord of the Yakshas, at the command of the Lord, appeared before him in a dream and bade him thus--To-day in the morning thou shalt get yourself shaved and stand concealed, stick in hand, at the door of thy house. Then whatever mendicant thou shalt see coming into thy courtyard, him thou shalt strike mercilessly with thy stick. Then the very moment the mendicant will turn into a pot full of gold coins. With that (wealth) thou canst live happily during the rest of thy life. Then these instructions being carried out the result followed (as directed). Now the barber who was called for
shaving saw this and said to himself.
Ah, this is the way to obtain a treasure. Why should I not then try the same! Thenceforward the barber, lying concealed
;hitoeng093.txt

93
in that manner every day, stick in hand, awaited a beggar's arrival. One day he, having found such a beggar, struck him with his stick and killed him. For that offence the barber, being punished by the king's officers, lost his life. Therefore I say, 'What was obtained by one through the force of merit' &c. The king remarked--
How can a stranger (i.e. his real character) be known by narrating stories of the past-whether he is a disinterested friend or a traitor ?
Well, let it pass. Let us attend to what concerns us immediately. If Chitravarna is on the table-land of Malaya, what is best to be done now? The minister said I have heard from the mouth of the spy that came here that Chitravarna has disregarded the counsel of the great minister, Vulture. It will be easy, therefore, to conquer the fool. For it is said--
An enemy who is avaricions, cruel, lazy, treacherous, careless, cowardly, unsteady, foolish, and a despiser of warriors, can be easily destroyed. -107.
Therefore before he blocks up the gates of our castle, let Sarasa and the other generals be ordered to rout his army in the rivers, mountains, wilds and passes. For it is said--
A king should cause the enemy's army to be destroyed when it is fatigued by long marches, hemmed in by rivers, mountains and forests, terrified by the fear of dreadful fires, distressed by hunger and thirst, 
[Page 81]
careless, engaged in eating, aflicted with diseases and famine (or want of supplies), not in good order (disorderly), reduced in numbers, distressed by rain and wind, incommodiously situated in places full of mud, dust or water, scattered about, or put to flight by robbers. Moreover,
A king should destroy (his enemy's army) sleeping by day being fatigued by its keeping awake (the whole night) through the fear of an attack, and thus having the soldiers in it over-powered by sleep.
For this reason, let our generals go and destroy the force of that careless (lit. blundering) king day and night, according to the opportunities they might get. This being done, many of the soldiers and generals of Chitravarna were killed. Upon this Chitravarna being dejected said to bis minister, Duradarsi--Sir, why do you neglect us? Have I in any matter acted insolently towards (insulted) you? For it is said -
;hitoeng094.txt

94
One should not act in an unbecoming way simply because one has obtained a kingdom; for insolence (lit. want of modesty) destroys wealth as old age destroys excellent beauty. Moreover,
One who is diligent gets wealth; he who eats what is whole; some gets health; a man who is healthy gets happiness; one who is resolute (lit. closely applying oneself to study) gets mastery over learning; and one who is well-trained, gets religious merit, wealth and fame.
The Vulture said-My lord, hear me,
A king although illiterate (not well-versed in politics) attains great prosperity by having in his service men advanced in knowledge, as does a tree growing by the water-side. Moreover,
Drinking, (inordinate attachment to) women, hunting, gambling, squandering (lit. wrong use) of money and the harshness of speech and punishment--these are the vices in (or, the sources of calamities to) kings. Again,
Neither by one wholly intent on enterprise (and hence acting precipitately), nor by one whose mind is tossed between means (and not coming to a decision), can noble riches be obtained : fortune abides in statesmanship and heroism.
Your Highness, observing (or, taking note of the (over-)enthusiasm (or activity) of your army and solely intent on adventure, did not heed even the counsels I laid before you, and used harsh words. Hence this is the fruit of your mis-behaviour (or, erroneous policy) that you have been experiencing. For it is said--
[Page 82]
What king who is ill-advised, (or, has bad ministers) does
not suffer from the (evil consequences of) errors of policy? Whom, eating unwholesome things, do diseases not afflict? Whom does not wealth make proud? Whom does not Death kill? And whom do not the amorous sports of women torment?
Moreover,
Dejection destroys joy, the advent of winter (the beauty of) autumn, the sun darkness, ingratitude a benedictory act, the attainment of what is desired (or, liked) sorrow, a right course of conduct adversity, and misbehaviour wealth, although abundant.
Then I too thought to myself—This king is wanting in discrimination. Or else, how can he obscure the moonlight of the counsels of political science with the flameless fire-brand (or, meteors) of (foolish) speeches? For,
;hitoeng095.txt

05
What good can science do to him who is himself wanting in talent? Of what service is a lamp to him who has no eyes?
For this reason I too remained quiet. Upon this the king said with folded hands--Sir, let this my fault be connived at. Now instruct me in such a way that having returned with the remnant of my forces I shall go back to the mountain Vindhya. The Vulture said to himself--This must be remedied. For,
In the case of deities, one's preceptor, cows, kings, Brahmanas, as also children, old men and sickly persons, anger should always be restrained. – 120
The minister having smiled said--Fear not my lord. Take heart. Listen, my lord--
The talent of ministers is tested (or, is exhibited) when a plan fails (or, when an alliance is broken), and that of physicians in disease wherein all the three humours are most malignantly disturbed: for who is not wise when all goes on smoothly? Moreover,
Little minds attempt little and are greatly embarrassed; while men of firm minds undertake great things and remain undisturbed.
Having therefore stormed the (enemy's) castle I will take you, in a short time, to the Vindhya mountain, accompanied with glory and power. The king asked--How can this be achieved now with the small force (at our command)? The Valture said-My lord, everything will be accomplished. Because in the case of a conqueror promptness of action is the guarantee for the accomplishment of success. Let the gates of the castle then be blocked up at once. After this, the spy, crane came to Hiranyagarbha and told him--Sire, king Chitravarna relying on the advice of the Vulture, small as his army, is, is going to blockade the castle-gates. The royal Swan said--Sarvajna, what is to be done now? Chakravaka replied--Let the discrimination of strong and weak men in our army be made. On that being known let presents of gold, garments and the like be made, as marks of royal favour, according to merit. For,
[Page 83]
The goddess of wealth never leaves him, the lion among kings, who saves even a cowri from being ill-spent, as if it were worth a thousand coins of gold, but spends in crores with a liberal hand on proper occasions. Again,
;hitoeng096.txt

96
In a sacrifice, on the occasion of a wedding, in (averting) a calamity, for the destruction of the enemy, in an act which would redound to one's fame, in securing friends, on beloved women, in (relieving) relations who are penniless-in these eight casess money can never be (said to be) over-spent.
For,
A fool for fear of spending a little brings about the ruin of the whole: what wise man will forego his merchandise through the extreme dread of duty (to be levied on it)?
The king asked--How can an extraordinary expenditure be advisable at this (critical time)? For it is said--One should save money against (pecuniary) difficulties. The minister--How can a monarch have difficulties? The king--Lakshmi sometimes forsakes (a king). The minister(wealth) even though hoarded vanishes. Leave aside, therefore, parsimony, my lord, and encourage your valiant soldiers with gifts and honours. For it is said--
Warriors who know each other, who are well pleased, who are bent on even sacrificing their lives and who are nobly born, when well honoured, conquer the enemy's force.
Moreover,
Even five hundred good warriors, who are possessed of excellent character, united, resoluto and brave, can rout a whole army of the enemy. Again,
A man who does not know how to discriminate (distinguish between good and bad), who is fierce and ungrateful, as also a seeker of self-interest, is abandoned even by the great; how much more so then by ordinary men? For,
Veracity, bravery, mercifulness and munificence-these are the principal qualities of a king : a prince who is void of those certainly meets with censure. - 130
On such an occasion, the ministers themselves, must, of necessity, be treated with marks of distinction. Says the precept--
He whose fortune is bound up with one's own, and who rises or falls along with one--him, a trusty person, one (a king) should appoint to guard his body (lit. life) and the treasury.
;hitoeng097.txt

For,
The king who has for his counsellors a rogue, a woman or a child, sinks into the ocean of state-business, being hurled into it by the gales of erroneous polioy.
Listen, my lord.
The earth will yield wealth to him whose joy and anger are well regulated, who has a firm belief in the teachinge of the Sastras, and who, every day, attends to his servants.
A king should never despise his ministers as such, whose rise and fall take place with his own. Since,
[Page 84]
When a king, blinded by vanity, sinks into the perilous ocean of state-matters, the action of a friendly ministry proves to be a helping hand (to him).
Now Meghavarna, having come and bowed to the king, said--My lord, favour me with a glance. The enemy is at the castle-gate anxious for fight. Sallying forth then, at the command of Your Majesty's feet, I will display my valour, by which (act) I will pay off the debt I owe to Your Majesty. Not so said Chakravaka. If we are to go out and fight, then in vain have we taken shelter in the fortress. Moreover,
A crocodile, although formidable, can be easily overcome when come out of water; and the lion, although brave, is like a jackal when he is out of the forest.
My lord, you should go in person and witness the fight.
For,
Having put forth his army, a king should make it fight under his own inspection: for, does not even a dog act the lion, indeed, when led on by his master?
Then they all went forth to the castle-gate and fought a great battle. The next day king Chitravarna said to the Vulture--Sir, fulfil (lit. bear out) your promise now. The Vulture said--My lord, just hear me.
When it (a fortress) is incapable of holding out for a long time, or is very small, or is commanded by a foolish or vicious officer, or is not well protected, or is manned by timid soldiers, that is said to be the calamity of a fortress.
As to this, it does not exist here.
Treachery, a prolonged siege, assault and daring valour (a desperate fight) these are declared as the four ways of capturing a fort.
;hitoeng098.txt

98
In this direction I will make an effort to the best of my ability. He whispers into his ear-Thus, thus. Then, as the battle raged at (all) the four gates of the fort, even before the san had risen, the crows set fire to the houses in the interior of the fort all at once. Thereafter, hearing the tumultuous cries--'The fort is taken, the fort is taken,'--and seeing the fire actually spreading through several houses, the soldiers of the royal Swan, as well as the other residents of the fortress, quickly entered the pond. For,
At the proper time and to the best of one's ability one should hold a good consultation, display good valour, fight bravely or effect an honourable (or, orderly) retreat, but should not (pause to think i.e., should not hesitate, but promptly act)-140.
The royal Swan, who, being habituated to ease, was moving slowly, accompanied by Sarasa, was attacked by the Cock, Chitravarna's general, and surrounded. Hiranyagarbha said to Sarasa--General Sarasa, you should not destroy yourself out of regard for me. You can still make good your escape. Go, then, and save yourself by plunging into the water. Make my son, Chudamani by name, king, with the consent of Sarvajna. Sarasa said--My lord, please utter not such unbearable words. May Your Majesty be triumphant as long as the sun and moon endure in heaven. My lord, I am the commanding officer of the castle. So the enemy shall enter by the gate-way smeared with my flesh and blood. Moreover, my lord--
[Page 85]
A master who is forbearing, munificent and an appreciator of merits, is obtained with difficulty.
The king observed--This is true, indeed, but--
Even a servant who is honest, diligent and devoted (to his master) is, I think, difficult to be found.
Sarasa said--My lord, hear me again.
If after having avoided a fight there could be no fear of death, then it would be proper to go away from here : but if death be the inevitable lot of a creature, why should reputation be tarnished in vain? Again,
In this wordly existence, which is as evanescent as the curling up (or, sportive motion) of a wave raised by the wind, the sacrificing of one's life for another's sake happens by virtue of merit.
;hitoeng099.txt

99
The king, the ministry, the country, the forts, the treasure, the army, the allies, the subjects (in general) and the orders of citizens are the essential constituents of a kingdom.
My lord, you are the master, and must be saved by every means. For,
The subjects when abandoned by the king cannot live, though prosperous : What can a physician do, although he be a Dhanvantari, to one whose life is spanned? Moreover,
When the lord of men perishes, the world of mortals also perishes, and when he rises it rises, even as a lotus fades when the sun sets and blooms when he rises.
By this time the Cock came and inflicted very severe wounds on the royal Swan's body with his claws. Thereupon the Sarasa quickly coming up screened the king with his own body. Thereafter the Sarasa, although overwhelmed with the strokes given by the Cock with his nails and bill, protected the king with his body and threw him into water with a push; and then slew the Cock, the general, with a stroke of his bill. Afterwards the Sarasa, too, was killed by many (attacking him) in a body. Now king Chitravarna entered the castle, caused the things in it to be taken away, and being hailed by bards singing the panegyrics of his victory, went back to his army.
Now the princes observed--In that army of the king that Sarasa alone was meritorious who saved his master by sacrificing his own body. For it is said--
All cows bring forth calves that have the shape of the cowkind: but some one alone produces one, the master of a herd (the best of bulls), having stout and muscular shoulders (lit., having shoulders that are rubbed against by his horns).
Vishnusarma said--May he, the magnanimous one, enjoy the blessings of heaven, having the females of the Vidyadharas as his attendants. For it is said--
Those brave men, devoted to their master and grateful, who sacrifice their lives for their master, go to heaven.
[Page 86]
Wherever a brave man is killed, surrounded by his enemies, he obtains the eternal worlds, if he does not show weakness (cowardice in battle).
You have heard (all that relates to) War. The princes said--We have heard it and become happy. Vishnusarma said--Let there be this much more also:
;hitoeng100.txt

100
Let kings never wage war, with elephants, horses and footsoldiers: but let their enemies flee for shelter to the caverns of mountains, being borne away by the gales of policy and counsel.-150
END OF THE THIRD COLLECTION OF STORIES IN THE HITOPADESA, STYLED 'WAR.'
Chapter IV.
PEACE
At the time of narrating the stories again the princes said--Sir, we have heard about war. Tell us what relates to Peace now. Vishnusarma said--May you listen. I will tell you even about Peace which is introduced by the following verse:--
When the great battle had taken place between the two kings whose armies were annihilated, a peace was made in a moment with their words by the arbiters, the Vulture and the Chakravaka.
The princes asked how it was. Vishnusarma thus related--Then the royal Swan asked--Who was it that threw fire into our fort? Was it a stranger (one from the party of the enemy) or some one residing in our fort, instigated by the enemy? Chakra, said--My lord, that causeless (disinterested) friend of Your Highness, Meghavarna, with his retinue, is not to be seen. So I think it must have been his work. The king reflecting for a moment said--This is surely (the play of) my evil luck. For it is said--
It is the fault of (adverse) fate and not of ministers, that a business, although well-planned, sometimes fails, as destiny would have it.
The minister said--This also is said--
Being reduced to an adverse state a man blames his fate; but the fool never knows (that it was the result of) his own faults in actions. Moreover,
That foolish man (lit. of wicked intellect), who does not approvingly follow the advice of his friends who have his welfare at heart, perishes like the silly tortoise that fell off from a piece of wood.
The king asked how it was, and the minister related--
FABLE I.
[Page 87]
In the country of Magadha there is a lake called Phullotpala (with-full-blown-lotuses). In it lived for a long time two geese,
;hitoeng101.txt

101
named Samkata and Vikata, and also a tortoise, their friend, named Kambugriva. Once some fishermen, having come there said--We shall stay here to-day and (to-morrow) morning kill the fishes, turtles and others. On hearing that the tortoise said to the geese--Friends, have you heard the talk of the fishermen? What should I do now? The geese replied-Let it be ascertained again (what they will do) and then we shall do in the morning what is proper to be done. The tortoise observed--Not so. For I have seen a past occurrence here (or, I have seen the evil consequences of such a course here;—or, I see danger in this). And in respect of this it is said--
Anagatavidhata (Provider-against-the-evil-not-come) and Pratyutpannamati (Ready-witted)—these two flourish happily while Yadbhavishya (Come-what-will-be) perishes.
The two asked--How was this? The tortoise then related--
FABLE II.
Formerly in this very lake, when fishermen like these had come, three fishes took counsel together. A fish, Anagatavidhata by name, was one of them. He said--As for myself I will go to another pond. Having said so he went to another pool. Another fish, Pratyutpannamati by name, observed--Since there is no certainty of future events happening (as expected or in a particular way) where can I go? So when the emergency arises I shall act as the occasion would require. For it is said--
He is (really) talented who counteracts (surmounts) a difficulty as it arises; just as the wife of a merchant concealed her lover before (his very) eyes. Yadbhavishya asked how it was. Pratyutpannamati related--
FABLE III.
There was in Vikramapura a merchant, Samudradatta by name. His wife, named Ratnaprabha, always sported with one of her servants. For,
There is no one who is disagreeable to women, nor one who is beloved by them ; but they ever long for a new one, like Cows sueking fresh grass in a forest.
Now on one occasion that Ratnaprabha was seen impressing a kiss on the servant's mouth, by Samudradatta. Thereupon that profligate woman going up to him quickly said--My lord, great must be the fondness for ease of this our servant, since I have
;hitoeng102.txt

102
found out by smelling his mouth that he eats camphor, having stolen it. For it is said--
The eating capacity of women (lit. food--as compared to that of men) is said to be twofold, their talent fourfold, their energy sixfold and their passion eightfold.
Hearing those words (of the woman) the servant getting angry said-Who can stay in the house of a master whose wife is of this sort house wherein the mistress smells the mouth of a servant every moment? Saying this he got up and walked off. The merchant with great difficulty persuaded him and retained him in his service. Hence I say-He is really talented who counteracts &c. Thereafter Yadbhavishya said--
[Page 88]
What is not to happen can never happen and what is to happen can never be otherwise: Why is this medicine, which destroys the poison of anxiety, not drunk?
Then in the morning Pratyutpannamati, being caught in the net, feigned himself dead and go remained. Thereafter being removed from the net he jumped to the utmost of his power and entered deep water. While Yadbhavishya being caught by the fishermen was killed. Hence I say--Anagatavidhata &c. Therefore so contrive it that I shall get to another pond to-day. The two geese said--You will be safe when another pond is reached. But what will be your means of safety (or, how will you fare) while going on land? The tortoise replied--Contrive that means by which I shall be able to go along with you by the aerial path. The two geese said--How can such a contrivance be possible? The tortoise replied--
You take in your beaks a piece of wood which I will seize by my mouth, so that I too shall go with ease by the force of your wings. The two geese said--This contrivance is possible. But,
While thinking out a remedy a wise man should also take into account accident (or, possible hindrances, obstacles): the young of a foolish crane were eaten by mungooses before his very eyes. -10.
The tortoise asked how it was. The two geese thus narrated--
FABLE IV.
There is in the Northern country a mountain Gridhrakuta by name. There in a fig tree on the bank of the Airavati lived
;hitoeng103.txt

103
some cranes; and in a hole at the foot of the tree lived a serpent who used to eat their little ones. Now a certain old crane, hearing the wail of the cranes afflicted with grief, said--Get some fish and have them spread one by one in a line from the burrow of the mungooses to the hole of the serpent. Then by the mungooses coming here, being attracted by the food, the serpent will necessarily be seen and killed on account of their natural antipathy. Now this being done what was expected came to pass. But the mungooses heard the cry of the young cranes; so after that they mounted the trees and ate the young ones of the cranes. For this reason we say--While thinking out a remedy a wise man, &c. On seeing you borne along by us the people must say something. Hearing that if you will give a reply your death is certain. So, all matters considered, you should stay here.
The tortoise replied--What? Am I a fool? I will not say anything. Then the plan being put into execution, all the cow-herds observing the tortoise in that situation ran after him and exclaimed:- Among them one said--If this tortoise falls he should be roasted just here and eaten. Another said--He should be dressed on the spot and eaten. A third said--We will take him home and eat him. On hearing those harsh words the tortoise, full of rage and forgetting his original resolve, said--You shall eat ashes. But just as he uttered these words he fell down and was killed by the cow-keepers. Hence I say--That fool who does not, &c. Now the crane, employed as a spy, came there and said--My lord, just at the beginning I had said it was necessary to search the castle every moment. You did not do that: and so the fruit of your neglect to attend to it (my warning) has been experienced. As to the burning of the fortress it was done by a crow named Meghavarna at the instigation of the minister, the Vulture. The king, sighing, said--
He, who puts confidence in his enemies either for affection (shown) or a friendly act done, is awakened (roused to stern reality) when ruined, like a man sleeping when fallen from the top of a tree.
[Page 89]
The spy said--When, having effected the burning of the castle, Meghavarna went away, Chitravarna being pleased said--Let this Meghavarna be installed king of this Karpuradvipa. For it is said--
;hitoeng104.txt

104
One should never ignore (lit. render fruitless) the service rendered by a servant who has done his duty; but should gladden (encourage) him by rewarding (his services) with the mind, speech and eyes.
Chakravaka--What then? The spy-Then the prime minister, the Vulture, said--my lord, this is not proper. Bestow upon him some other favour. For,
Giving advice to one who is inconsiderate is simply like pounding chaff (a bootless labour); an obligation conferred upon a mean person is like pissing on sand.
Moreover, a base man should not be placed in the station of the great. For,
A low person having obtained an exalted position desires to kill his master, just as a mouse having been raised to the state of a tiger went forth to kill the sage.
Chitravarna asked--How was this? The minister related--
FABLE V.
In the penance-grove of the great sage Gotama there lived a hermit, Mahatapas by name. He (once) saw, in the vicinity of his hermitage, a young mouse fallen from the mouth of a crow. The sage being naturally tender-hearted reared it up with grains of wild rice. Now a cat ran to eat the moase, on seeing which it ran to the sage's lap for shelter. Then the sage said--O mouse, be thou a cat. Then the cat would ran away on seeing a dog. Then the sage said-Thou fearest a dog? Be thou a dog thyself. Now the dog was afraid of a tiger, so that the dog was changed into a tiger by the sage. But although a tiger, the sage did not regard him as anything better than a mouse. Now all the people when they saw the sage and the mouse would say--By the sage the mouse was changed into a tiger. Hearing this, the tiger, being distressed at heart, said to himself-So long as this saint lives, this ignominious talk about my real nature will not vanish. Thus reflecting he went forth to kill the saint. Thereupon the holy man, knowing that (his intention), again changed him into a mouse, saying--Be thou a mouse again. Hence I say, a mean man having obtained an exalted post &c.
Moreover, you should not think that this is easy to do. Listen.
Having devoured many fishes of the best, middle and the ordinary sort, a crane died afterwards through excessive greed,
;hitoeng105.txt

105
being seized by a crab. Chitravarna demanded how it was, whereupon the minister thus related--
FABLE VI.
[Page 90]
There is, in the Malaya (Malwa) country, a lake, Padmagarbha by name. There a certain crane who was old and decrepit stood showing himself to be sad at heart. He was observed by a crab and asked - Why do you stand thus without looking for food! The crane said--Friend, listen. The fish are the means of my sustenance. And they are certain to be killed by fishermen coming here. (For) such a talk I heard near the city. So for want of means of subsistence my death is imminent. Aware of this I am not thinking of eating even. Now all the fishes thought to themselves:-This time at least he appears to be our benefactor. So let us just consult him as to what is best to be done. For it is said--
An alliance should be formed even with an enemy disposed to do a service, and not with a friend doing injury: for a deed of benevolence and injury should be known to be the signs of these (i.e., a man being a friend or foe).
The fishes asked--o crane, what is the means of our safety now? The crane replied --There is a remedy for your protection, viz., going to another pond. I shall carry you one by one there. The fishes said--Let it be so done. Then the crane carried the fishes one by one and devoured them. After that the crab said–-O crane, take me there also. Thereupon, the crane too, longing for the flesh of the crab which he had never tasted before, carried him there and placed him on the ground. The crab also, seeing the place strewn with the bones of the fishes, said to himself--Alas! I am undone, an unlucky creature. Well, I will act now as the time requires. For,
One should dread a danger so long as it has not come : but seeing that the danger has arrived, one should strike a blow like a hero (lit., like one not daunted, or boldly). Moreover,
When a wise man being attacked sees no benefit to himself (from not fighting) he dies fighting with his foe (or, he dies fighting, along with his foe). Again,
When without fighting destruction is certain, but in fighting there is some chance of living--that the wise declare to be the time for fighting.
Thus reflecting the crab cut off the neck of the crane, who threupon died. Hence I say–-Having devoured many fishes
;hitoeng106.txt

106
&c. Upon this king Chitravarna said again :-Just hear me, minister. I have thought thus of the matter. That Meghavarna, if left king here, will send us all the best things that are to be found in Karpuradvipa, so that I might live in great luxury on mount Vindhya. Duradarsi, having smiled, said--My lord,
He who rejoices over things which have not come to pass suffers contempt like the Brahmana who broke the pots. -20.
[Page 91]
The king asked how it was, the minister went on--
FABLE VII.
There was a Brahmana, called Devasarma, in the city of Devakota. On the great equinox day he got (as present) an earthen pot full of barley. With it, he, being oppressed with the heat of the sultry sun, slept in a part of a potter's shed filled with earthenware. Then having taken a stick in his hand to protect the Saktus (from mice) he fell into a reverie-If by selling this barley-pot I can get ten cowries, I will buy with them pitchers, Saravas and the like, just here. Selling these (at an advantage), and with the money thus increased manifold, I will buy, over and over again, betel-nuts, cloth and other articles, and will raise my fortune till it could be reckoned by lacs, and then marry four wives. I will then show greater love to her among the fellow-wives who is endowed with beauty and youth. Then when her co-wives, their jealousy being excited, will quarrel with her, I being overpowered by rage, will strike them with a stick thus--With these words he hurled forth the stick (he had in his hand), so that his pot containing the barley was broken into pieces and many other pots destroyed. Now the noise brought in the potter who discovering the pots in that condition reproved the Brahmana and drove him out of the interior of the shed. I say therefore--He who rojoices over things &c.
On hearing this the king said to the Vulture--Friend, tell me what is proper to be done. The Vulture said--
Of a king swollen with pride as of an elephant in rat (infuriated, ungovernable), and therefore going astray, the leaders (advisers, drivers), indeed, meet with censure (incur blame).
I solicit your attention, my lord. Did we conquer the fort by the pride of our strength (or, army, i.e., by sheer force) or rather by a stratagem, suggested by your glory? The king
;hitoeng107.txt

107
replied--By means of a scheme devised by Your Excellency. The Vulture said-If my advice is to be followed, then let us go back to our country. Else, after the advent of the rainy season, if the war is renewed with an enemy of equal power, it will be impossible for us, who are stationed in a foreign country, even to return home. So having made peace for the attainment of both prosperity and glory, let us go away. The fortress has already been taken and renown gained. This much is what I approve of. For,
A king has a (true) adviser (lit. helper) in him, who considering his duty as foremost and not minding what his master likes or dislikes, says things which are true although unpalatable.
In a battle both the parties are sometimes ruined; so one should not jeopardize his advantages : thus has Brihaspati declared. Moreover,
Who, that is not an idiot, will risk (lit., place on the swing of doubt) in a battle the army of his allies, his kingdom, his own self, as well as his reputation? Moreover,
[Page 92]
One should desire friendly alliance even with one's equals, since victory in a battle is uncertain : for were not Sunda and Upasunda, of equal valour, destroyed by each other?
The king asked how it was: the minister told (the following tale):
FABLE VIII.
In days of yore, two demons, Sunda and Upasunda by name, who were brothers, with the desire of obtaining the sovereignty of the three worlds, devoted themselves to Siva's worship for a long time, suffering great bodily torment. Then the deity being pleased with them asked them to name the boon they wanted. Now the two, owing to the (influence of) the goddess of learning who had possessed them, gave utterance to quite a different wish from what they had intended to do. They said--If the Almighty God is pleased with us, may he give us his consort Parvati. Then the Deity, although enraged, seeing that the granting of the boon was inevitable, gave Parvati to those fools. Thereupon they two, the destroyers of the world and representing (as it were) sin and darkness (ignorance), being captivated by the excellence of her beauty and mentally yearning after her, began to quarrel,
;hitoeng108.txt

108
each saying that she was his. But they having agreed between themselves to refer the matter to an umpire, that same Deity stood before them having come there in the form of an old Brahmana. Upon this the two asked the Brahmana--We have obtained this (goddess) by our own might. To which of us does she belong? The Brahmana spoke--
A Brahmana is esteemed when he is distinguished for his knowledge, a Kshatriya when powerful, a merchant when pre-eminently in possession of wealth and grain, and a Sudra when serving the twice-born.
Now you two are the followers of the duties proper for the Kshatriyas; and so the rule for you is to fight. After this declaration, saying 'He has spoken well', the two whose valour was equally matched, struck each other at one and the game time, and met their doom. Therefore I say--One should form a friendly alliance even with one's equal, &c. The king--Why did you not say so before? The Minister--Did Your Highness hear my speech to its end? And even then this war was not commenced with my consent. This Hiranyagarbha possesses qualities which make him a fit person to form an alliance, and not to wage war with. For it is said--
One who is veracious, one who is noble-minded, one who is righteous, one who is mean-minded (or not an Aryan), one in union with a number of brothers (or, relatives), one who is powerful, and one who is victorious in many battles—those seven kings are mentioned as fit to be entered into an alliance with.
One, who is veracious, is ever faithful to truth, and will not change afterwards when united by an alliance. He who is noble-minded, it is quite evident, will never act meanly even though his life be threatened.
For a righteous king, if attacked, every one will fight : he who is righteous is difficult to be uprooted on account of the love of his subjects and his dutifulness (his just conduct).
An alliance should be formed even with one who is mean-minded, when destruction is imminent; for without his assistance one who is noble-minded cannot pass time happily. -30.
Just as a bamboo covered over with thorne cannot be (easily) uprooted on account or its being in close union (with others), so cannot one in union with a multitude of relatives.
;hitoeng109.txt

109
There is no ordinance which says that one should fight with one's superior in power; for a cloud cannot, indeed, move contrary to the wind.
[Page 93]
Through the prowess of one who has been victorious in many battles, like that of Parasurama (the son of Jamadagni), every one is made subservient (to one's wishes) in every place and at all times.
Enemies quickly yield to him with whom a victor in many battles forms an alliance, through his (the latter's) prowess.
Then this king, who is endowed with many qualities, should be made peace with. Chakravaka said--Spy, we have known everything. Go now and come back having gathered further intelligence. The king asked Chakravaka--Minister, who are those with whom it is not advisable to form an alliance? I wish to know them also. The minister replied--My lord, I will tell you that. Kindly listen.
One who is a child, who is old, who is subject to protracted diseases, he who is excommunicated from (or, disowned by) his caste, who is timid or has timid servants, who is avaricious or has avaricious servants, whose subjects (or, ministers) are disattached, who is exceedingly addicted to carnal pleasures, who is fickle-minded in receiving his counsels, who talks ill (or speaks disrespectfully) of the gods and the Brahmanas (a blasphemer), one condemend by fate, a fatalist, he who is smitten with the calamity of famine, who is in danger (or, difficulty) from his army, one not in his own country (or, one not a native of the country), one who has many enemies, one whom time does not favour (i.e., fighting at a very unfavourable time), and one who has departed from truth and religion (an apostate)--these are the twenty men (or kings) with whom one should not make peace but simply fight on; for those, if warred against in no time, fall into their enemy's hands.
On account of the little power (or, influence) a child(-king) possesses, people do not wish to fight for him; because one of a tender age is not able to know the fruit (consequences) of
fighting or not fighting.
He who is old, and he who has been long ailing--these two, being destitute of the power of energy, are, undoubtedly, overpowered by their own men. He, who has been disowned by all his kinsmen, is easily uprooted; for those very kinsmen, when won over, kill him. -41.42

[Page 94]
A coward, by reason of his giving up fighting, draws down ruin on himself. Similarly he who has timid servants is deserted by them in a battle.
By reason of his not distributing the spoils of war, the followers of an avaricious king do not fight for him. He who has greedy followers is killed by them when estranged by gifts (given by his enemies).
He whose subjects (or, ministers) are disaffected is forsaken by them in battle. One excessively attached to pleasures is easily assailable.
He who is fickle-minded in receiving his counsels is disliked by his ministers; and, on account of the unsteadiness of his mind, he is neglected by them in an important affair (or, when a necessity arises).
Owing to the supreme power of Dharma (religion, he who speaks irreverently of the gods and the Brahmanas perishes of himself, as also one who is smitten by Fate.
Fate, indeed, is the only cause of prosperity or adversity :he, who, depending on Fate, goes on thinking thus, does not move even for himself.
He who is overtaken by the calamity of a famine is ruined, while he who has danger from his army (or, whose army is disaffected) is unable to commence war.
He who is out of his country can be easily killed even by a petty foe, just as an alligator, although small, can drag even a powerful elephant. -50
Ho, who has many enemies, is, when embarrassed, like a pigeon in the midst of hawks; by whatever way he may pass, there he is killed in no time.
He who marches with (lit. musters) his army out of season is killed by one fighting in right time (i. e. seizing the most advantageous opportunity), as is a crow, with its vision gone at midnight, by an owl.
One should never make an alliance with him who is false to truth and religion; for, although won over by an alliance, such a man, on account of his perfidious nature, will soon undergo a change.
I will also give you additional information on the subject. Making peace, fighting, marching against the enemy, waiting (for better opportunities &c.), seeking shelter (by resorting to a fortress or a powerful king) and duplicity,--these are the six expedients. Finding out means to begin an undertaking, having
;hitoeng111.txt

111
at command an abundance of men and stores, the proper division (affixing) of time and place, providing against accidents, and the final attainment of the desired object--these are the five parts of (the results to be attained by) counsel. Conciliation (the age of pacific means), giving gifts, discord (sowing seeds of dissension) and chastisement,--these are the four means. The power arising from the king's personal energy, the power arising from good counsel, and the power due to the possession of an adequate army and treasury-these are the three regal powers. Having always paid due attention to all these, sovereigns, who wish to make conquests, become great.
[Page 95]
Royal fortune, which is not to be obtained even for the price of the abandonment of life, runs to the house of those who are consummate politicians, although fickle.
It is also said--
He whose wealth is equally apportioned, whose spies are well-disguised, whose counsel is kept secret, and who never speaks a harsh word to men, governs the earth bounded by the oceans (the whole).
Now, my lord, although the greater minister, Vulture, has proposed peace, yet that king, through the pride of his recent success, will not consent to it. So let this policy be adopted. Let the Sarasa king of Ceylon, Mahabala by name, our ally, cause a disturbance (by attacking it) in Jambudvipa. For,
A war-like prince, marching about under profound secrecy with a well-composed army, should harass his enemy, so that he will be equally worried; for one, who is a flicted (lit. heated), will make peace with another equally afflicted.
The king, having approved of the plan, sent a crane, named Vichitra, to Ceylon with a confidential letter. Now the spy came and said--Sire, please listen to the affairs of the place. The vulture said this there. Since Meghavarna had stayed there for a long time, he knows whether or not king Chitravarna possesses qualities which make him a worthy person to make an alliance with. Thereupon that Meghavarna was called and asked by the king--Mr. crow, what sort of a king is that Hiranyagarbha or what sort of a minister is Chakravaka ? The crow replier--Sire, king Hiranyagarbha is as magnanimous as Yudhishthira, while a minister of Chakravaka's type can nowhere be found. The king remarked--If so, how is it that he was taken in by you? Meghavarna observed with a smile--My lord,
;hitoeng112.txt

112
What ingenuity is there in deceiving those who have reposed confidence (in you)? What sort of prowess is that if one kills a man who has fallen asleep having reclined on the lap?
Listen, my lord. The minister knew me at first sight. But the king was noble-minded, and so I could deceive him. And it is said--
He, who from his own analogy considers a knave to be a speaker of truth, is deceived, just as the Brahmana was by rogues with respect to a goat.
The king asked how it was. The crow thus related--
FABLE IX.
A certain Brahmana had commenced a sacrifice in Gotama's forest. As he was wending his way back after having purchased a goat for the sacrifice at some village and taken it on his shoulders, he was noticed by three villains. Then the villains, thinking to themselves that if by some means they could get the goat they would display their wit to its utmost, stood under three trees at an interval of two miles each, on the way, awaiting the Brahmana's arrival. Now as the Brahmana passed on, one of the villains said--Ho Brahmana, why is it that you are carrying a dog on your shoulder? The Brahmana replied--this is not a dog, but a sacrificial goat. Then he was addressad the game question by another villain standing next (to the first). On hearing that the Brahmana took off the goat from his shoulder, placed it on the ground and having examined it again and again, replaced it on his shoulder and set off, but with a wavering mind. For,
[Page 96]
Surely the mind even of the good wavers on hearing the words of the wicked; and he who is led into confidence by such (words) perishes, as did the camel Chitrakarna.
The king asked how it was, upon which he thus west on :--
FABLE X.
In a certain part of a forest there lived a lion, by name Madotkata. He had three servants, a crow, a tiger and a jackal. Once, as they were roaming about, they saw a camel that had strayed from the herd and asked him where he had come from. He told his account. Then he was taken to the lion and presented. The lion gave him his word of safety, named him Chitrakarna and asked him to stay with him. Now on one occasion, owing to the lion's indisposition and there being a heavy rain, they, not getting anything to eat, were in distress.
;hitoeng113.txt

113
Then they fell thinking--Let us manage things in such a way that our master will kill Chitrakarna. What have we to do with this thorn-eater? The tiger said--Our master has favoured him by giving his word of surety. How can this be possible then? The crow observed--Now that our master is grown lean (for want of food) he will commit even sin. For,
A woman oppressed with hunger will abandon even her son; a female serpent distressed with hunger will eat even her egg; what sinful act is a hungry man not capable of? Men when reduced to poverty, become cruel. Again, -60.
A drunkard, one exceedingly careless, one gone mad (or, who is delirious), one fatigued, one who is in the power of anger, one who is hungry, one who is covetous, one who is timid, one engaged in a business brooking no delay, and a lover, mind not what is just.
Having thus deliberated they went to the lion. The lion asked--Have you got anything for food? They said--We have found nothing, even after an effort. The lion asked--What is the means of our sustenance now? The crow replied--By your not availing yourself of the food at command we are all in the jaws of death. What is the food at my command?-asked the lion. The crow whispered into his ear—Chitrakarna. The lion having touched the ground and then his ears, said--We have retained him here by pledging our word of safety. So how can this be possible ?
As they (the wise) speak of the gift of safety as the greatest of all gifts, so they do not talk of land, nor of gold, nor of a cow, nor of food. Moreover,
If a supplicant be well protected, that fruit is obtained which is the reward of the performance of a horse-sacrifice which is rich in the gift of (i.e. which grants) all desires.
The crow said your lordship need not kill him. But we shall so contrive it that he will consent to offer his own body. The lion, on hearing this, remained silent. Getting an opportunity thereby, the crow fabricated a plot and taking them all with him went up to the lion. Now the crow said--Lord, even after busy search we have found nothing to eat. While our lord is distressed by many fasts. So let him eat my flesh. For,
[Page 97]
All subjects have, indeed, the king for their root (chief support). If the trees have roots (then only) man's effort (to rear them) will be successful.
;hitoeng114.txt

114
The lion replied--Friend, better to part with life than to proceed to do a deed like this. The jackal, too, said the same thing, to which the lion replied that it could not be done. Then the tiger said--Let the master live on my flesh. The lion replied--This can never be proper. Now Chitravarna too, having got confidence, made a similar offer of himself. Just as he was saying that, the tiger ripped his side and killed him, after which he was eaten by them all. Hence I say--Surely the mind of the good &c. Then hearing the words of the third villain, the Brahmana, concluding that his own understanding was in error, throw down the goat, bathed and went home. Hence I say--He who from his own analogy considers a knave &c. The king asked--Meghavarna, how could you live so long among the enemies, and how could you win their favour? Meghavarna replied--Sire, what can one seeking to execute his master's business or having his own interest at heart not do? Behold:
Do not people bear, O king, fuel on their heads for burning? The tide of a river, alhough was ing the root of a tree, destroys it. Again it is said--
Having to achieve an object, a wise man should even bear his enemies on his shoulder, just as the frogs were destroyed by an old serpent (by doing so).
The king demanded how it was, and Meghavarna related as follows.
FABLE XI.
There was in Jirnodyana (an old garden) an old serpent, named Mandavisha. He, unable to look for his food even, on account of his extreme old age, stretched himself on the bank of a lake and so lay there. Then being seen by some frog from a distance he was asked-- Why don't you go in quest of your food? The serpent replied--Go your way, friend. What have you to do by questioning me, an unlucky creature? Thereupon, his curiosity being roused, the frog insisted on his telling it. The serpent said--Friend, I, wicked that I was, bit, as ill-luck would have it, the son of Kaundinya, a learned Brahmana, residing in Brahmapura, who was about twenty years old and endowed with all the virtues. Then seeing his son, whose name was Susila, dead, Kaundinya swooned away and rolled on the ground. Now all his relatives residing in Brahmapura came there and sat down. For it is said--
;hitoeng115.txt

115
He is a relative who stands by one in a battle, in adversity, in times of famine, when a kingdom is subverted, at the royal gate, and in the cemetery.
Among them, one Kapila by name, who had just finished his course of Vedic stadies, said--Oh Kaundinya, your reason is gone and hence you lament thus. Hear--
[Page 98]
Since Frailty, like a midwife, takes on her lap a creature that is born first, and the mother afterwards, what occasion is there for sorrow?
Where are those potentates gone, with their armies, bodyguards and equipages, the witness of whose exit (from her), the Earth stands as yet? Moreover,
The body is liable to accidents (lit. has accidents near to it), wealth is the abode of misfortunes, and unions are followed by separations—overything created is fragile. - 70.
The body, decaying every moment, is not observed (to do so), but is perceived when dead like a raw earthen pot placed in water when dissolved.
Death approaches a creature nearer and nearer every day, just as it does at every step of the man who is being conducted to the place of execution.
Transient are youth, beauty, life, hoarded wealth, progperity and the company of beloved persons: a wise man should not allow himself to be deluded by them.
Just as two pieces of wood come together on the surface of the ocean, and, having met, part again, so (of a similar nature) is the association of creatures (they come together only to part again).
As some traveller halts under a shade, and having taken rest proceeds on his journey again, such is the company of creatures. Again,
When the body which is composed of the five elements is reduced to those five again, each component part being resolved into its original element, where is the room for wailing?
As many darts of sorrow are driven into a man'a heart as the number of connexions, delightful to the heart, he forms.
An eternal association, even with one's own body, is not obtained by any one; how little then with anything else?
Moreover,
Connexion certainly indicates the possibility of separation, as birth indicates the coming of death which is unavoidable.
;hitoeng116.txt

116
The result of associations with beloved persons, which are pleasant only in the beginning (or, at the first sight), is exceedingly dreadful, like that of unwholesome victuals eaten. -80
Again,
As the streams of rivers (ever) pass (flow) on, and never turn back, so do day and night, taking away with them men's lives.
The company of the good, which in this worldy life gives the best pleasure, is set at the head of miseries by reason of its
ending in separation. 
[Page 99]
For this reason good men do not wish for the company of the good; for there is no medicine for (healing) the mind when wounded by the sword of their separation.
Meritorious were the acts done by Bharata and other kings; but those very acts, and they too, have met their end (have been buried in oblivion).
By his repeatedly thinking of death, of terrible punishment, all the efforts of a wise (thinking) man are relaxed, like leather-(straps or) knots when besprinkled with rain-water.
The very first night on which a man comes, O king, to reside in the womb, journeying steadily on (lit. without breaking his journey), from that night he approaches death nearer and nearer every day.
For this reason, to those who take a right view (or, understand the real nature) of this worldly existence, such sorrow is but the outcome (lit. expansion) of ignorance. Behold--
If ignorance is not the cause, but separation is the cause,
of sorrow, then as days pass on, it ought to increase: how does it abate?
Therefore, friend, think of yourself (or, compose yourself) and give up indulgence in sorrow. For,
Not to think of them at all is the great medicine for the deep wounds of sorrow which appear all of a sudden, which are fresh, and which cut the vital parts.
Now, hearing his words, Kaundinya rose up, appearing to be enlightened on the subject, and said--Away with residence in the hell of a house. To the forest itself shall I retire. Kapila observed again--
Even in a forest impediments (or, temptations) overtake those who are affected by passion; even in a house restraining the five organs of sense constitutes penance: the home is a
;hitoeng117.txt

117
penance-grove to him, with passions subdued, who proceeds in an act which is irreproachable. For,
An afflicted man, in whatever Asrama (stage of life) he may choose to be, should do the duties of religion, treating all creatures equally: external signs (such as bearing the holy staff, wearing dyed garments &c.) are not the cause of the performance of religious rites. – 90.
It is also said--
Those, who eat just to support life, lead a married life for progeny, and have speech but to declare the truth, surmount difficulties.
So also,
[Page 100]
The soul is a river which has self-restraint for its holy stairs, truthfulness for its water, good disposition for its banks and mercy for its waves : bathe in this river, O son of Pandu : the inner soul is not purified by (physical) water. More especially,
He enjoys happiness who renounces this exceedingly worthless worldly life which is overwhelmed with the pains of birth, death, old age and diseases. For,
Pain is the real thing (existing in this world), and not happiness, since that is observed : the term happiness is applied to the removal of the pain) of one afflicted with sorrow.
Kaundinya said--Just so. Then the Brahmana, afflicted with sorrow, cursed me, saying--'From to-day thou shalt be the carrier of serpents.' Kapila said--Now you are incapable of listening to advice. Your heart is heavy with grief. Still, hear what is fit to be done.
Association (with other persons) should be given up by all means; if it cannot be given up it should be made with the good; for the company of the good is a medicine (for the disease of attachment to worldly things). Moreover,
Desire should be abandoned by overy effort; if it cannot be abandoned, it should be entertained with respect to final emancipation; for such a desire is the medicine for (removing) it (desire in general).
On hearing this, that Kaundinya, the fire of whose sorrow was extinguished by the water of Kapila's advice, became an ascetic (lit. took the holy staff). So, owing to the Brahmana's curse, I lie here to carry the frogs.
;hitoeng118.txt


Now that frog went to the king of frogs, Jalapada by name, and informed him of that. Then the chief of the frogs came there and mounted the serpent's back. The serpent, too, taking him on his back, moved about stepping beautifully. The next day, finding him unable to move about, the chief of serpents asked him why he was slow to move. The serpent replied--My lord, I am weak on account of want of food. The frog-king replied--We command you to eat frogs. Then saying, “This great favour is accepted," he ate up the frogs gradually. After that, finding the pond void of frogs, he devoured the frog-king also. Hence I say-–Having to achieve an object, a wise man should even bear his enemies &c. Now, my lord, let as have done with the narration of old stories. My opinion is that we should make peace with this king, Hiranyagarbha, who is amply worthy of an alliance. The king said--What means this idea of yours? For we have beaten him in war. If, therefore, he lives as our vassal, let him do so; else we shall fight him again.
Just at the time a parrot coming from Jambudvipa said--Lord, the Sarasa king of Ceylon has invaded Jambudvipa and continues to be there. The king asked in great confusion--What? The parrot told the same thing again. The Vulture said to himself--Well done, minister Chakravaka: you, all-knowing one, excellent, excellent! The king in anger-Let this king be alone then. Him I will first go and destroy, root and branch. The minister, Far-seeing, having smiled, observed-- 
[Page 101]
One should not thunder in vain like the autumnal clouds : a great man does not disclose to another the object he seeks or does not seek (or the evil he meets with, or does not proclaim the good or evil he means to do another). Moreover,
A king should not engage many foes (lit. invaders) simultaneously; even the haughty (proud) cobra is certainly killed by many insects.
My lord, why should we go (from here) without concluding a treaty? For, in that case, he (Hiranyagarbha) will raise an insurrection after we leave. Again,
He, who without having ascertained the real truth about a thing (the true fact) yields himself up to anger, repents, as did the thoughtless Brahmana on account of his mungoose.
The king asked how it was. Duradarsi thus related--
;hitoeng119.txt

FABLE XII.
There lived in Ujjayini a Brahmana, named Madhava. His wife who had been brought to bed left the Brahmana in charge of her infant child and went out to bathe. In the meantime the Brahmana received an invitation from the king to receive the presents to be given on the occasion of the Paryana Sraddha. On getting that the Brahmana, being naturally poor, thought to himself-If I do not go quickly some other Brahmana will take the presents. For,
If what is to be taken, what is to be given and what is to be done be not quickly attended to, time saps their best essence. - 104
But there is no one here to take care of the child. What shall I do now? Or why care thus! I will appoint this mungoose here, which has been long tended by me and is just like a son to me, to look after the child, and go. He did so and went away. After he had gone, the mungoose seeing a black serpent crawling to the child, killed it and cut it into pieces. Presently the mungoose, seeing the Brahmana coming, ran to him with its mouth and paws covered with blood and rolled at his feet. Then the Brahmana, seeing it in that condition and concluding that it had eaten the child, killed it. After that as soon as the Brahmana went in and looked at his child, he found it lying down comfortably (quite well), while a serpent lay there killed. Then looking at his mungoose that had done him a service, his heart was pervaded with emotion and he was smitten with bitterest sorrow. Hence I say--'He who without ascertaining the real truth' etc. Moreover,
One should give up the collection of these six, viz., lust, anger, want of judgement, greed, vanity and haughtiness: when these are abandoned a man becomes happy.
The king asked--Minister, is this your resolve? The minister replied--Just so. For,
Remembrance of important (weighty) affairs, clever guessing, decisive knowledge, firmness of purpose and secrecy of counsel are the most important qualities in a minister. Also,
One should not do a thing rashly: want of due consideration is the most favourite abode of misfortunes: riches, of their own accord, seek (lit. choose) him who acts after due deliberation. being attracted by his merit.
[Page 102]
So my lord, if you are to follow my advice you should go after concluding a treaty. For,
;hitoeng120.txt

120
Although four means are pointed out (mentioned) for the accomplishment of the desired object, their use is simply to make up the number; real success rests firmly with peace.
He asked-How can this (the concluding of a treaty) be possible? The minister--My lord, this can be quickly brought about. For,
An ignorant man man be easily satisfied; still more easily can one who is eminently learned: but even Brahma himself cannot please a man who is vainly proud of his little knowledge.
Especially because the king knows his duty and the minister is all-knowing. I knew this from the words of Meghavarna as well as from the business accomplished by them.
In all cases the virtuous tendencies (or, the virtues and tendencies) of those who are absent (lit. out of eight) are to be inferred from actions; therefore the proceedings of those whose actions are not to be observed are known from the ends achieved.
The king-Enough of discussion (lit. answers and replies). You may follow the policy you approve of. After this talk the great minister, Vulture, saying, 'I will do what befits the occasion,' set out for the interior of the castle. Now the crane, employed as a spy, came and said to Hiranyagarbha--
The great minister, Vulture, is coming to us to conclude a treaty. The royal Swan said--Minister, some partisan (of the enemy) might be coming here. Sarvajna, smiling, observed My lord, there is no room for suspicion in this case. For this personage is the magnanimous Duradarsi. Or rather, such is the behaviour of the weak-mined (or dull-headed). Sometimes they have no suspicion at all; at others they would suspect everything. For,
A swan, searching for lotus-sprouts (or stalks) in a lake at night, and therefore unable to discern (them) properly, being several times deceived by his seeing the reflections of stars (which he mistook for lotuses), does not eat the white lotus even during day-time, suspecting it to be a star: a man when once surprised (deceived) by a fraud, suspects evil even in truth.
When a man's mind is vitiated by wicked men, he has no confidence even in good men. A child having got (his hand) burnt by payasa (milk boiled with sugar, rice &c.) eats curdled milk after having cooled it with his breath.
;hitoeng121.txt

121
Moreover,
My lord, let us, therefore, hold in readiness presents of jewels and other things, the best that our means can allow, for his reception. This being done, the minister Vulture, who was received with marks of respect at the castle-gate by Chakravaka, having advanced forth, was conducted in and presented to the king, after which he sat on the seat that was offered to him. Chakravaka said--You are the master of all things here. Enjoy this kingdom according to your pleasure. The royal Swan said--Just so Duradarsi observed--It is just so. A speech, at considerable length, is unnecessary now. For,
[Page 103]
One should win over a covetous man by wealth, the stubborn by joining the hands (by submission), a fool by ministering to his whims (humouring him), and a learned man by truthfulness (by whatever is suitable to the particular case).
A man should gain over a friend by honesty of purpose (sincerity of feeling), his relatives by ready reception, his wife and servants by gifts and an honourable treatment, and other people by a courteous behaviour, -110.
You should therefore conclude a peace with this king, Chitravarna, of mighty power, and send him away. Chakravaka said--Kindly tell us also the conditions on which the (or how a) treaty is to be made. The royal Swan-What are the possible kinds of treaties? The Vulture replied--I will tell you. May you listen--
A king, distressed by being attacked by a more powerful (enemy) and having no other alternative left, should sue for peace, wishing to gain time.
Kapala, Upahara, Samtana, Samgata, Upanyasa, Pratikara, Samyoga, Parushantara, Adrishtanara, Adishta, Atmadishta, Upagraha, Parikraya, Uchchhanna, Parabhushana and Skandhopaneya-these sixteen are enumerated as the varieties of Peace. Thus do those who are well acquainted with the subject of treaties declare the sixteen species.
That is known to be Kapala Samdhi which is formed on equal terms (or between equal parties), while that is called Upahara which is brought about by (one of the parties giving) gifts (to the other).
The Samtana Samdhi is that in which the gift of a daughter in marriage precedes (is the preliminary condition), while Samgata is declared by the wise to be that which is formed on
11
;hitoeng122.txt

122
the foundation of friendship. It is this Samgata Samdhi, which lasts during life in which the interests of both the parties are equally represented, and which is not broken by accidents (or, causes) either in prosperous or adverse times, that is also called, on account of its superior excellence, like that of gold, Kanchana, by those adept in the science of forming alliances.
That which is made by having in view the accomplishment of one's own object is called Upanyasa by those versed in the doctrine of making overtures of peace (to an enemy).
I have conferred a favour upon him: he will repay it: the alliance which is formed on this principle is styled Pratikara.-120
I will render a service to him, and he too will render a similar one to me--that which is formed with such an intention is also denominated Pratikara, as in the case of Rama and Sugriva.
When, having definitely aimed at the achievement of one common object (one goal to be reached), (two parties) enter into an alliance duly ratified (or, the terms of enforcement being
well-secured), it is called Samyoga.
[Page 104]
That alliance in which a condition is made (by each party)
that its interests can be safeguarded by its principal warriors, is Purushantara.
That in which an enemy lays down the condition that a particular party alone will accomplish his purpose is said to be Adrishtapurusha.
That in which a powerful (victorious) enemy forms an alliance on condition that a portion of land is ceded (to him by the other party) is designated Adishta by those versed in the doctrine of peace-making.
That is spoken of as Atmadishta in which common cause is made with one's own army. And when everything is relinquished to the enemy as the (only) means of saving one's life, that is called Upagraha.
That is styled Parikraya which is made at the cost of a part of, or the half of, or even the whole of, the treasury, in order that the rest (other property) may be saved.
That wherein very valuable lands are relinquished is called Uchchhanna ; and when the whole fruit (produce) of the land is given away, it is called Parabhushana (ornament to the enemy).
That alliance in which a specified quantity (part of the produce of the land) that can be borne on the shoulders is
;hitoeng123.txt

123
given, those conversant with the art of making peace call Skandhopaneya.
That in which there is reciprocal obligation (Pratikara), that which is based on friendship (Samgata), that based on relationship (Samtana) and Upahara (secured by gifts)--these four should be known as the real varieties of Samdhi. - 130.
Or rather in my opinion Upahara is the only real kind of Peace, all the others (lit. those different from Upahara) are without friendship (i.e. they fail to secure real friendship).
A (successful) invader (conqueror), on account of his being the more powerful, does not return without getting something; hence there is no other mode of Samdhi than Upahara.
Chakravaka said--Just hear me.
This is our relative, this is a stranger-such a reckoning belongs to the low-minded; but the large-minded regard the world itself as their family. Moreover,
He is a wise man (has true insight into philosophy) who regards another's wife as his mother, another's wealth as a clod of earth, and all creatures as his own self.
The king said--Your Honour is profoundly learned. You should therefore tell us what is best to be done. The minister replied--Ah, why do you ask me this?
Who will act unrighteously for the sake of the body which, owing to mental or bodily affliction, must fall to-day or tomorrow (i. e. at any moment)?
The life of creatures is, indeed, as fleeting (lit. unsteady) as the reflection of the moon in water: knowing that it is such, one
should always do what is (truly) beneficial.
[Page 105]
Seeing that worldly existence is as transitory as a mirage, one should associate with the good, both for the performance of duty and happiness.
Then according to my opinion let that alone (association with the good) be done. For,
If a thousand horse-sacrifices and truth be weighed (against each other), truth would weigh heavier than a thousand Asvamedhas.
Therefore let there be concluded between these two kings the Peace called Kanchana (the golden one) of which truth is the principal ordeal (binding authority). Sarvajna said--Let it be so. Then the minister Duradarsi, who was duly honoured by the king, the royal Swan, was highly delighted at heart and
;hitoeng124.txt

124
returned, with Chakravaka, into the presence of the royal Peacock. There, at the instance of the Vulture, king Chitravarna converged with Sarvajna in a manner in which great respect was shown to him and presents were given; and the latter, having ratified (lit. accepted) the Peace as mentioned, came back to the presence of the royal Swan.
Duradarsi said--Lord, we have gained our wishes. Now let us turn back and go to our residence, the mountain Vindhya. Thereupon all of them went home and enjoyed the fruit (happiness) their hearts had cherished.
Vishnusarma said--What more should I tell you? Declare that. The princes said--By your favour we have known that branch of knowledge which relates to (or, to the various departments of) the administration of a state and have become happy thereby. Visnusarma observed--Although it is so, let there be this much more also:
May peace be ever for the delight of all victorious kings; may the good be free from calamities; may the glory of the virtuous over increase; may state-policy, like a harlot, abiding in the minds (on the bosom) of ministers, ever kiss their mouths; and may there be great rejoicing (among people) day by day!!
And this much in addition--
As long as the moon-crested god (Siva), the abode of the love of the Snow-mountain's daughter (Parvati) exists, as long as Lakshmi sports in the heart of Murari (Vishnu) like lightning flashing in the clouds; and as long as there exists the Gold-mountain (Meru) which resembles an (immense) wild fire and whose spark is the sun; so long may continue in circulation this collection of stories made by Narayana!! - 140.
And lastly,
May the prosperous king, Dhavalachandra, be victorious over his enemies;--he, who with an effort, got this compendium of stories to be made and published!
