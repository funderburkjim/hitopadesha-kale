python program to generate a list of all dates in a year, in the format YYYY-MM-dd
Here is a Python program that generates a list of all dates in a year, in the format YYYY-MM-dd:
** program
import datetime

def get_dates_in_year(year):
    start_date = datetime.date(year, 1, 1)
    end_date = datetime.date(year, 12, 31)
    delta = datetime.timedelta(days=1)
    dates = []
    while start_date <= end_date:
        dates.append(start_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))
        start_date += delta
    return dates

year = 2023
dates = get_dates_in_year(year)
print(dates)

** Bing explanation
This program defines a function get_dates_in_year that takes a year as input and returns a list of all dates in that year. The function uses the datetime module to create start_date and end_date objects representing the first and last days of the year. It then creates a delta object representing one day and uses it to increment the start_date object by one day at a time until it reaches the end_date. The strftime method is used to format each date as a string in the desired format.
