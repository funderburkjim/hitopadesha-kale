; hitopadesha-slp1_p.txt
; Begun 07-24-2019 as copy of hitopadesha-slp1.txt
; Incorporates the 'marma-prakASikA' commentary of Kale -- these are
; the Sanskrit notes at the bottom of each page.
; These notes are inserted below the Analyzed Sandhi lines
; Format is ###.##P: <slp1 text>
;  There may be more than one ###.##P line, if a given line of text has
;  comments on more than one word. For example, see line 001.04 below.
; Also, use ###.##PE: <English translation of the prakASikA> [not present]
; ------------------------------------------------
; A convention of this file is that lines starting with semicolon are comments
; Begun approx. Apr 2016
; Each line is represented in two forms:
;  F  is the final sandhi form; this is the version one sees printed
;  A  is the analyzed sandhi form.  Here words are separated, if needed,
;     and word endings are changed to their original (pre-sandhi) form.
;     This step of analysis facilitates the further analysis of grammatical
;     form

; 2018-12-02   hitokale_slp1_v0.txt
; Begin a new phase. Previous version hitopadesha-slp1.txt
;  The aim now is to use the exact text of Kale's edition:
;      The Hitopadesha of Narayana by M.R. Kale,
;      6th edition Aug 15, 1967. Motilal Banarsidass.
; Reason: We have previously been using the version from Sanskrit Documents (SD)
;   website  (reference elsewhere: TODO)
; However, there are various differences between Kale's version and this
; version.  These differences make difficult the correlation between
; the Sanskrit text and Kale's English translation.
; Large chunks of the SD text are identical to Kale, but many small and
; some large variances appear.  I've been handling these differences in
; various ways, but am now thinking that it would be better to have the
; text of Kale exactly.
; The line numbers of form #### currently relate to the original SD document.
; Preliminary format of Kale line numbers will be as '###.##'  (page.line)
; and some lines will have form '###.## ####' with both line numbers.
; Kale's comments at the bottom of pages are NOT included currently.

; hitokale_slp1_v1.txt  12/25/2018
; This replaces the xxxxF: or xxxxA: line numbering of original hitopadesha-slp1.txt
; Instead, the line numbering PPP.LLF: (or PPP.LLF:) is used.
; The PPP is Kale page number, and is believed to agree with the page number of the Kale text.
; The line number (LL) is less accurately related to the lines of a page of Kale text.
; The difference is believed to be almost entirely within the 'prose' (non-verse) sections.
; Also, the verse text should almost entirely correspond to the Kale text.
; In particular, the verse numbering should agree;
; and the number of lines per verse should agree  (most verses take 2 lines, and the
; second line has the verse number at the end (form .. VVV .. ; sometimes the space between
; V and ending '..' is missing).
; PA :  sandhi analyzed form of marma-prakASikA
; ° : marker for undisplayed text.
